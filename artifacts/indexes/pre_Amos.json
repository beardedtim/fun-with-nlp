    "text": "The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa\u2014the vision he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. He said:\n\u201cThe Lord roars from Zion\n    and thunders from Jerusalem;\nthe pastures of the shepherds dry up,\n    and the top of Carmel withers.\u201d This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Damascus,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause she threshed Gilead\n    with sledges having iron teeth, I will send fire on the house of Hazael\n    that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad. I will break down the gate of Damascus;\n    I will destroy the king who is in the Valley of Aven\nand the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden.\n    The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,\u201d\nsays the Lord. This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Gaza,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause she took captive whole communities\n    and sold them to Edom, I will send fire on the walls of Gaza\n    that will consume her fortresses. I will destroy the king of Ashdod\n    and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon.\nI will turn my hand against Ekron,\n    till the last of the Philistines are dead,\u201d\nsays the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Tyre,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause she sold whole communities of captives to Edom,\n    disregarding a treaty of brotherhood, I will send fire on the walls of Tyre\n    that will consume her fortresses.\u201d This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Edom,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause he pursued his brother with a sword\n    and slaughtered the women of the land,\nbecause his anger raged continually\n    and his fury flamed unchecked, I will send fire on Teman\n    that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.\u201d This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Ammon,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead\n    in order to extend his borders, I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah\n    that will consume her fortresses\namid war cries on the day of battle,\n    amid violent winds on a stormy day. Her king will go into exile,\n    he and his officials together,\u201d\nsays the Lord. \n\nThis is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Moab,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause he burned to ashes\n    the bones of Edom\u2019s king, I will send fire on Moab\n    that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth.\nMoab will go down in great tumult\n    amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet. I will destroy her ruler\n    and kill all her officials with him,\u201d\nsays the Lord. This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Judah,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nBecause they have rejected the law of the Lord\n    and have not kept his decrees,\nbecause they have been led astray by false gods,\n    the gods their ancestors followed, I will send fire on Judah\n    that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.\u201d This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cFor three sins of Israel,\n    even for four, I will not relent.\nThey sell the innocent for silver,\n    and the needy for a pair of sandals. They trample on the heads of the poor\n    as on the dust of the ground\n    and deny justice to the oppressed.\nFather and son use the same girl\n    and so profane my holy name. They lie down beside every altar\n    on garments taken in pledge.\nIn the house of their god\n    they drink wine taken as fines. \u201cYet I destroyed the Amorites before them,\n    though they were tall as the cedars\n    and strong as the oaks.\nI destroyed their fruit above\n    and their roots below. I brought you up out of Egypt\n    and led you forty years in the wilderness\n    to give you the land of the Amorites. \u201cI also raised up prophets from among your children\n    and Nazirites from among your youths.\nIs this not true, people of Israel?\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cBut you made the Nazirites drink wine\n    and commanded the prophets not to prophesy. \u201cNow then, I will crush you\n    as a cart crushes when loaded with grain. The swift will not escape,\n    the strong will not muster their strength,\n    and the warrior will not save his life. The archer will not stand his ground,\n    the fleet-footed soldier will not get away,\n    and the horseman will not save his life. Even the bravest warriors\n    will flee naked on that day,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \n\nHear this word, people of Israel, the word the Lord has spoken against you\u2014against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: \u201cYou only have I chosen\n    of all the families of the earth;\ntherefore I will punish you\n    for all your sins.\u201d Do two walk together\n    unless they have agreed to do so? Does a lion roar in the thicket\n    when it has no prey?\nDoes it growl in its den\n    when it has caught nothing? Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground\n    when no bait is there?\nDoes a trap spring up from the ground\n    if it has not caught anything? When a trumpet sounds in a city,\n    do not the people tremble?\nWhen disaster comes to a city,\n    has not the Lord caused it? Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing\n    without revealing his plan\n    to his servants the prophets. The lion has roared\u2014\n    who will not fear?\nThe Sovereign Lord has spoken\u2014\n    who can but prophesy? Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod\n    and to the fortresses of Egypt:\n\u201cAssemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria;\n    see the great unrest within her\n    and the oppression among her people.\u201d \u201cThey do not know how to do right,\u201d declares the Lord,\n    \u201cwho store up in their fortresses\n    what they have plundered and looted.\u201d Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n\u201cAn enemy will overrun your land,\n    pull down your strongholds\n    and plunder your fortresses.\u201d This is what the Lord says:\n\u201cAs a shepherd rescues from the lion\u2019s mouth\n    only two leg bones or a piece of an ear,\nso will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued,\n    with only the head of a bed\n    and a piece of fabric from a couch.\u201d \u201cHear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,\u201d declares the Lord, the Lord God Almighty. \u201cOn the day I punish Israel for her sins,\n    I will destroy the altars of Bethel;\nthe horns of the altar will be cut off\n    and fall to the ground. I will tear down the winter house\n    along with the summer house;\nthe houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed\n    and the mansions will be demolished,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \n\nHear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria,\n    you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy\n    and say to your husbands, \u201cBring us some drinks!\u201d The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness:\n    \u201cThe time will surely come\nwhen you will be taken away with hooks,\n    the last of you with fishhooks. You will each go straight out\n    through breaches in the wall,\n    and you will be cast out toward Harmon,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cGo to Bethel and sin;\n    go to Gilgal and sin yet more.\nBring your sacrifices every morning,\n    your tithes every three years. Burn leavened bread as a thank offering\n    and brag about your freewill offerings\u2014\nboast about them, you Israelites,\n    for this is what you love to do,\u201d\ndeclares the Sovereign Lord. \u201cI gave you empty stomachs in every city\n    and lack of bread in every town,\n    yet you have not returned to me,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cI also withheld rain from you\n    when the harvest was still three months away.\nI sent rain on one town,\n    but withheld it from another.\nOne field had rain;\n    another had none and dried up. People staggered from town to town for water\n    but did not get enough to drink,\n    yet you have not returned to me,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cMany times I struck your gardens and vineyards,\n    destroying them with blight and mildew.\nLocusts devoured your fig and olive trees,\n    yet you have not returned to me,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cI sent plagues among you\n    as I did to Egypt.\nI killed your young men with the sword,\n    along with your captured horses.\nI filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps,\n    yet you have not returned to me,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cI overthrew some of you\n    as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\nYou were like a burning stick snatched from the fire,\n    yet you have not returned to me,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cTherefore this is what I will do to you, Israel,\n    and because I will do this to you, Israel,\n    prepare to meet your God.\u201d He who forms the mountains,\n    who creates the wind,\n    and who reveals his thoughts to mankind,\nwho turns dawn to darkness,\n    and treads on the heights of the earth\u2014\n    the Lord God Almighty is his name. \n\nHear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: \u201cFallen is Virgin Israel,\n    never to rise again,\ndeserted in her own land,\n    with no one to lift her up.\u201d This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel:\n\u201cYour city that marches out a thousand strong\n    will have only a hundred left;\nyour town that marches out a hundred strong\n    will have only ten left.\u201d This is what the Lord says to Israel:\n\u201cSeek me and live; do not seek Bethel,\ndo not go to Gilgal,\n    do not journey to Beersheba.\nFor Gilgal will surely go into exile,\n    and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.\u201d Seek the Lord and live,\n    or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire;\nit will devour them,\n    and Bethel will have no one to quench it. There are those who turn justice into bitterness\n    and cast righteousness to the ground. He who made the Pleiades and Orion,\n    who turns midnight into dawn\n    and darkens day into night,\nwho calls for the waters of the sea\n    and pours them out over the face of the land\u2014\n    the Lord is his name. With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold\n    and brings the fortified city to ruin. There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court\n    and detest the one who tells the truth. You levy a straw tax on the poor\n    and impose a tax on their grain.\nTherefore, though you have built stone mansions,\n    you will not live in them;\nthough you have planted lush vineyards,\n    you will not drink their wine. For I know how many are your offenses\n    and how great your sins.\nThere are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes\n    and deprive the poor of justice in the courts. Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times,\n    for the times are evil. Seek good, not evil,\n    that you may live.\nThen the Lord God Almighty will be with you,\n    just as you say he is. Hate evil, love good;\n    maintain justice in the courts.\nPerhaps the Lord God Almighty will have mercy\n    on the remnant of Joseph. Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says:\n\u201cThere will be wailing in all the streets\n    and cries of anguish in every public square.\nThe farmers will be summoned to weep\n    and the mourners to wail. There will be wailing in all the vineyards,\n    for I will pass through your midst,\u201d\nsays the Lord. Woe to you who long\n    for the day of the Lord!\nWhy do you long for the day of the Lord?\n    That day will be darkness, not light. It will be as though a man fled from a lion\n    only to meet a bear,\nas though he entered his house\n    and rested his hand on the wall\n    only to have a snake bite him. Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light\u2014\n    pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness? \u201cI hate, I despise your religious festivals;\n    your assemblies are a stench to me. Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings,\n    I will not accept them.\nThough you bring choice fellowship offerings,\n    I will have no regard for them. Away with the noise of your songs!\n    I will not listen to the music of your harps. But let justice roll on like a river,\n    righteousness like a never-failing stream! \u201cDid you bring me sacrifices and offerings\n    forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? You have lifted up the shrine of your king,\n    the pedestal of your idols,\n    the star of your god\u2014\n    which you made for yourselves. Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,\u201d\n    says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty. \n\nWoe to you who are complacent in Zion,\n    and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria,\nyou notable men of the foremost nation,\n    to whom the people of Israel come! Go to Kalneh and look at it;\n    go from there to great Hamath,\n    and then go down to Gath in Philistia.\nAre they better off than your two kingdoms?\n    Is their land larger than yours? You put off the day of disaster\n    and bring near a reign of terror. You lie on beds adorned with ivory\n    and lounge on your couches.\nYou dine on choice lambs\n    and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David\n    and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful\n    and use the finest lotions,\n    but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;\n    your feasting and lounging will end. The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself\u2014the Lord God Almighty declares:\n\u201cI abhor the pride of Jacob\n    and detest his fortresses;\nI will deliver up the city\n    and everything in it.\u201d If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them asks anyone who might be hiding there, \u201cIs anyone else with you?\u201d and he says, \u201cNo,\u201d then he will go on to say, \u201cHush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.\u201d For the Lord has given the command,\n    and he will smash the great house into pieces\n    and the small house into bits. Do horses run on the rocky crags?\n    Does one plow the sea with oxen?\nBut you have turned justice into poison\n    and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness\u2014 you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar\n    and say, \u201cDid we not take Karnaim by our own strength?\u201d For the Lord God Almighty declares,\n    \u201cI will stir up a nation against you, Israel,\nthat will oppress you all the way\n    from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.\u201d \n\nThis is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king\u2019s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, \u201cSovereign Lord, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!\u201d So the Lord relented.\n\u201cThis will not happen,\u201d the Lord said. This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: The Sovereign Lord was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. Then I cried out, \u201cSovereign Lord, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!\u201d So the Lord relented.\n\u201cThis will not happen either,\u201d the Sovereign Lord said. This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand. And the Lord asked me, \u201cWhat do you see, Amos?\u201d\n\u201cA plumb line,\u201d I replied.\nThen the Lord said, \u201cLook, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. \u201cThe high places of Isaac will be destroyed\n    and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined;\n    with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.\u201d Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: \u201cAmos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. For this is what Amos is saying:\n\u201c\u2018Jeroboam will die by the sword,\n    and Israel will surely go into exile,\n    away from their native land.\u2019\u201d Then Amaziah said to Amos, \u201cGet out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. Don\u2019t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king\u2019s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.\u201d Amos answered Amaziah, \u201cI was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. But the Lord took me from tending the flock and said to me, \u2018Go, prophesy to my people Israel.\u2019 Now then, hear the word of the Lord. You say,\n\u201c\u2018Do not prophesy against Israel,\n    and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.\u2019 \u201cTherefore this is what the Lord says:\n\u201c\u2018Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,\n    and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword.\nYour land will be measured and divided up,\n    and you yourself will die in a pagan country.\nAnd Israel will surely go into exile,\n    away from their native land.\u2019\u201d \n\nThis is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: a basket of ripe fruit. \u201cWhat do you see, Amos?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cA basket of ripe fruit,\u201d I answered.\nThen the Lord said to me, \u201cThe time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. \u201cIn that day,\u201d declares the Sovereign Lord, \u201cthe songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many, many bodies\u2014flung everywhere! Silence!\u201d Hear this, you who trample the needy\n    and do away with the poor of the land, saying,\n\u201cWhen will the New Moon be over\n    that we may sell grain,\nand the Sabbath be ended\n    that we may market wheat?\u201d\u2014\nskimping on the measure,\n    boosting the price\n    and cheating with dishonest scales, buying the poor with silver\n    and the needy for a pair of sandals,\n    selling even the sweepings with the wheat. The Lord has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: \u201cI will never forget anything they have done. \u201cWill not the land tremble for this,\n    and all who live in it mourn?\nThe whole land will rise like the Nile;\n    it will be stirred up and then sink\n    like the river of Egypt. \u201cIn that day,\u201d declares the Sovereign Lord,\n\u201cI will make the sun go down at noon\n    and darken the earth in broad daylight. I will turn your religious festivals into mourning\n    and all your singing into weeping.\nI will make all of you wear sackcloth\n    and shave your heads.\nI will make that time like mourning for an only son\n    and the end of it like a bitter day. \u201cThe days are coming,\u201d declares the Sovereign Lord,\n    \u201cwhen I will send a famine through the land\u2014\nnot a famine of food or a thirst for water,\n    but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord. People will stagger from sea to sea\n    and wander from north to east,\nsearching for the word of the Lord,\n    but they will not find it. \u201cIn that day\n\u201cthe lovely young women and strong young men\n    will faint because of thirst. Those who swear by the sin of Samaria\u2014\n    who say, \u2018As surely as your god lives, Dan,\u2019\n    or, \u2018As surely as the god of Beersheba lives\u2019\u2014\n    they will fall, never to rise again.\u201d \n\nI saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:\n\u201cStrike the tops of the pillars\n    so that the thresholds shake.\nBring them down on the heads of all the people;\n    those who are left I will kill with the sword.\nNot one will get away,\n    none will escape. Though they dig down to the depths below,\n    from there my hand will take them.\nThough they climb up to the heavens above,\n    from there I will bring them down. Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,\n    there I will hunt them down and seize them.\nThough they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea,\n    there I will command the serpent to bite them. Though they are driven into exile by their enemies,\n    there I will command the sword to slay them.\n\u201cI will keep my eye on them\n    for harm and not for good.\u201d The Lord, the Lord Almighty\u2014\nhe touches the earth and it melts,\n    and all who live in it mourn;\nthe whole land rises like the Nile,\n    then sinks like the river of Egypt; he builds his lofty palace in the heavens\n    and sets its foundation on the earth;\nhe calls for the waters of the sea\n    and pours them out over the face of the land\u2014\n    the Lord is his name. \u201cAre not you Israelites\n    the same to me as the Cushites?\u201d\ndeclares the Lord.\n\u201cDid I not bring Israel up from Egypt,\n    the Philistines from Caphtor\n    and the Arameans from Kir? \u201cSurely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord\n    are on the sinful kingdom.\nI will destroy it\n    from the face of the earth.\nYet I will not totally destroy\n    the descendants of Jacob,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord. \u201cFor I will give the command,\n    and I will shake the people of Israel\n    among all the nations\nas grain is shaken in a sieve,\n    and not a pebble will reach the ground. All the sinners among my people\n    will die by the sword,\nall those who say,\n    \u2018Disaster will not overtake or meet us.\u2019 \u201cIn that day\n\u201cI will restore David\u2019s fallen shelter\u2014\n    I will repair its broken walls\n    and restore its ruins\u2014\n    and will rebuild it as it used to be, so that they may possess the remnant of Edom\n    and all the nations that bear my name,\u201d\ndeclares the Lord, who will do these things. \u201cThe days are coming,\u201d declares the Lord,\n\u201cwhen the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman\n    and the planter by the one treading grapes.\nNew wine will drip from the mountains\n    and flow from all the hills, and I will bring my people Israel back from exile.\n\u201cThey will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them.\n    They will plant vineyards and drink their wine;\n    they will make gardens and eat their fruit. I will plant Israel in their own land,\n    never again to be uprooted\n    from the land I have given them,\u201d\nsays the Lord your God. \n\n",
