Bitterly she weeps at night,\n    tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong all her lovers\n    there is no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have betrayed her;\n    they have become her enemies. After affliction and harsh labor,\n    Judah has gone into exile.\nShe dwells among the nations;\n    she finds no resting place.\nAll who pursue her have overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress. The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to her appointed festivals.\nAll her gateways are desolate,\n    her priests groan,\nher young women grieve,\n    and she is in bitter anguish. Her foes have become her masters;\n    her enemies are at ease.\nThe Lord has brought her grief\n    because of her many sins.\nHer children have gone into exile,\n    captive before the foe. All the splendor has departed\n    from Daughter Zion.\nHer princes are like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nin weakness they have fled\n    before the pursuer. In the days of her affliction and wandering\n    Jerusalem remembers all the treasures\n    that were hers in days of old.\nWhen her people fell into enemy hands,\n    there was no one to help her.\nHer enemies looked at her\n    and laughed at her destruction. Jerusalem has sinned greatly\n    and so has become unclean.\nAll who honored her despise her,\n    for they have all seen her naked;\nshe herself groans\n    and turns away. Her filthiness clung to her skirts;\n    she did not consider her future.\nHer fall was astounding;\n    there was none to comfort her.\n\u201cLook, Lord, on my affliction,\n    for the enemy has triumphed.\u201d The enemy laid hands\n    on all her treasures;\nshe saw pagan nations\n    enter her sanctuary\u2014\nthose you had forbidden\n    to enter your assembly. All her people groan\n    as they search for bread;\nthey barter their treasures for food\n    to keep themselves alive.\n\u201cLook, Lord, and consider,\n    for I am despised.\u201d \u201cIs it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look around and see.\nIs any suffering like my suffering\n    that was inflicted on me,\nthat the Lord brought on me\n    in the day of his fierce anger? \u201cFrom on high he sent fire,\n    sent it down into my bones.\nHe spread a net for my feet\n    and turned me back.\nHe made me desolate,\n    faint all the day long. \u201cMy sins have been bound into a yoke;\n    by his hands they were woven together.\nThey have been hung on my neck,\n    and the Lord has sapped my strength.\nHe has given me into the hands\n    of those I cannot withstand. \u201cThe Lord has rejected\n    all the warriors in my midst;\nhe has summoned an army against me\n    to crush my young men.\nIn his winepress the Lord has trampled\n    Virgin Daughter Judah. \u201cThis is why I weep\n    and my eyes overflow with tears.\nNo one is near to comfort me,\n    no one to restore my spirit.\nMy children are destitute\n    because the enemy has prevailed.\u201d Zion stretches out her hands,\n    but there is no one to comfort her.\nThe Lord has decreed for Jacob\n    that his neighbors become his foes;\nJerusalem has become\n    an unclean thing among them. \u201cThe Lord is righteous,\n    yet I rebelled against his command.\nListen, all you peoples;\n    look on my suffering.\nMy young men and young women\n    have gone into exile. \u201cI called to my allies\n    but they betrayed me.\nMy priests and my elders\n    perished in the city\nwhile they searched for food\n    to keep themselves alive. \u201cSee, Lord, how distressed I am!\n    I am in torment within,\nand in my heart I am disturbed,\n    for I have been most rebellious.\nOutside, the sword bereaves;\n    inside, there is only death. \u201cPeople have heard my groaning,\n    but there is no one to comfort me.\nAll my enemies have heard of my distress;\n    they rejoice at what you have done.\nMay you bring the day you have announced\n    so they may become like me. \u201cLet all their wickedness come before you;\n    deal with them\nas you have dealt with me\n    because of all my sins.\nMy groans are many\n    and my heart is faint.\u201d \n\nHow the Lord has covered Daughter Zion\n    with the cloud of his anger!\nHe has hurled down the splendor of Israel\n    from heaven to earth;\nhe has not remembered his footstool\n    in the day of his anger. Without pity the Lord has swallowed up\n    all the dwellings of Jacob;\nin his wrath he has torn down\n    the strongholds of Daughter Judah.\nHe has brought her kingdom and its princes\n    down to the ground in dishonor. In fierce anger he has cut off\n    every horn of Israel.\nHe has withdrawn his right hand\n    at the approach of the enemy.\nHe has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire\n    that consumes everything around it. Like an enemy he has strung his bow;\n    his right hand is ready.\nLike a foe he has slain\n    all who were pleasing to the eye;\nhe has poured out his wrath like fire\n    on the tent of Daughter Zion. The Lord is like an enemy;\n    he has swallowed up Israel.\nHe has swallowed up all her palaces\n    and destroyed her strongholds.\nHe has multiplied mourning and lamentation\n    for Daughter Judah. He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden;\n    he has destroyed his place of meeting.\nThe Lord has made Zion forget\n    her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths;\nin his fierce anger he has spurned\n    both king and priest. The Lord has rejected his altar\n    and abandoned his sanctuary.\nHe has given the walls of her palaces\n    into the hands of the enemy;\nthey have raised a shout in the house of the Lord\n    as on the day of an appointed festival. The Lord determined to tear down\n    the wall around Daughter Zion.\nHe stretched out a measuring line\n    and did not withhold his hand from destroying.\nHe made ramparts and walls lament;\n    together they wasted away. Her gates have sunk into the ground;\n    their bars he has broken and destroyed.\nHer king and her princes are exiled among the nations,\n    the law is no more,\nand her prophets no longer find\n    visions from the Lord. The elders of Daughter Zion\n    sit on the ground in silence;\nthey have sprinkled dust on their heads\n    and put on sackcloth.\nThe young women of Jerusalem\n    have bowed their heads to the ground. My eyes fail from weeping,\n    I am in torment within;\nmy heart is poured out on the ground\n    because my people are destroyed,\nbecause children and infants faint\n    in the streets of the city. They say to their mothers,\n    \u201cWhere is bread and wine?\u201d\nas they faint like the wounded\n    in the streets of the city,\nas their lives ebb away\n    in their mothers\u2019 arms. What can I say for you?\n    With what can I compare you,\n    Daughter Jerusalem?\nTo what can I liken you,\n    that I may comfort you,\n    Virgin Daughter Zion?\nYour wound is as deep as the sea.\n    Who can heal you? The visions of your prophets\n    were false and worthless;\nthey did not expose your sin\n    to ward off your captivity.\nThe prophecies they gave you\n    were false and misleading. All who pass your way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey scoff and shake their heads\n    at Daughter Jerusalem:\n\u201cIs this the city that was called\n    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of the whole earth?\u201d All your enemies open their mouths\n    wide against you;\nthey scoff and gnash their teeth\n    and say, \u201cWe have swallowed her up.\nThis is the day we have waited for;\n    we have lived to see it.\u201d The Lord has done what he planned;\n    he has fulfilled his word,\n    which he decreed long ago.\nHe has overthrown you without pity,\n    he has let the enemy gloat over you,\n    he has exalted the horn of your foes. The hearts of the people\n    cry out to the Lord.\nYou walls of Daughter Zion,\n    let your tears flow like a river\n    day and night;\ngive yourself no relief,\n    your eyes no rest. Arise, cry out in the night,\n    as the watches of the night begin;\npour out your heart like water\n    in the presence of the Lord.\nLift up your hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint from hunger\n    at every street corner. \u201cLook, Lord, and consider:\n    Whom have you ever treated like this?\nShould women eat their offspring,\n    the children they have cared for?\nShould priest and prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord? \u201cYoung and old lie together\n    in the dust of the streets;\nmy young men and young women\n    have fallen by the sword.\nYou have slain them in the day of your anger;\n    you have slaughtered them without pity. \u201cAs you summon to a feast day,\n    so you summoned against me terrors on every side.\nIn the day of the Lord\u2019s anger\n    no one escaped or survived;\nthose I cared for and reared\n    my enemy has destroyed.\u201d \n\nI am the man who has seen affliction\n    by the rod of the Lord\u2019s wrath. He has driven me away and made me walk\n    in darkness rather than light; indeed, he has turned his hand against me\n    again and again, all day long. He has made my skin and my flesh grow old\n    and has broken my bones. He has besieged me and surrounded me\n    with bitterness and hardship. He has made me dwell in darkness\n    like those long dead. He has walled me in so I cannot escape;\n    he has weighed me down with chains. Even when I call out or cry for help,\n    he shuts out my prayer. He has barred my way with blocks of stone;\n    he has made my paths crooked. Like a bear lying in wait,\n    like a lion in hiding, he dragged me from the path and mangled me\n    and left me without help. He drew his bow\n    and made me the target for his arrows. He pierced my heart\n    with arrows from his quiver. I became the laughingstock of all my people;\n    they mock me in song all day long. He has filled me with bitter herbs\n    and given me gall to drink. He has broken my teeth with gravel;\n    he has trampled me in the dust. I have been deprived of peace;\n    I have forgotten what prosperity is. So I say, \u201cMy splendor is gone\n    and all that I had hoped from the Lord.\u201d I remember my affliction and my wandering,\n    the bitterness and the gall. I well remember them,\n    and my soul is downcast within me. Yet this I call to mind\n    and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord\u2019s great love we are not consumed,\n    for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning;\n    great is your faithfulness. I say to myself, \u201cThe Lord is my portion;\n    therefore I will wait for him.\u201d The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him,\n    to the one who seeks him; it is good to wait quietly\n    for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man to bear the yoke\n    while he is young. Let him sit alone in silence,\n    for the Lord has laid it on him. Let him bury his face in the dust\u2014\n    there may yet be hope. Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him,\n    and let him be filled with disgrace. For no one is cast off\n    by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion,\n    so great is his unfailing love. For he does not willingly bring affliction\n    or grief to anyone. To crush underfoot\n    all prisoners in the land, to deny people their rights\n    before the Most High, to deprive them of justice\u2014\n    would not the Lord see such things? Who can speak and have it happen\n    if the Lord has not decreed it? Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\n    that both calamities and good things come? Why should the living complain\n    when punished for their sins? Let us examine our ways and test them,\n    and let us return to the Lord. Let us lift up our hearts and our hands\n    to God in heaven, and say: \u201cWe have sinned and rebelled\n    and you have not forgiven. \u201cYou have covered yourself with anger and pursued us;\n    you have slain without pity. You have covered yourself with a cloud\n    so that no prayer can get through. You have made us scum and refuse\n    among the nations. \u201cAll our enemies have opened their mouths\n    wide against us. We have suffered terror and pitfalls,\n    ruin and destruction.\u201d Streams of tears flow from my eyes\n    because my people are destroyed. My eyes will flow unceasingly,\n    without relief, until the Lord looks down\n    from heaven and sees. What I see brings grief to my soul\n    because of all the women of my city. Those who were my enemies without cause\n    hunted me like a bird. They tried to end my life in a pit\n    and threw stones at me; the waters closed over my head,\n    and I thought I was about to perish. I called on your name, Lord,\n    from the depths of the pit. You heard my plea: \u201cDo not close your ears\n    to my cry for relief.\u201d You came near when I called you,\n    and you said, \u201cDo not fear.\u201d You, Lord, took up my case;\n    you redeemed my life. Lord, you have seen the wrong done to me.\n    Uphold my cause! You have seen the depth of their vengeance,\n    all their plots against me. Lord, you have heard their insults,\n    all their plots against me\u2014 what my enemies whisper and mutter\n    against me all day long. Look at them! Sitting or standing,\n    they mock me in their songs. Pay them back what they deserve, Lord,\n    for what their hands have done. Put a veil over their hearts,\n    and may your curse be on them! Pursue them in anger and destroy them\n    from under the heavens of the Lord. \n\nHow the gold has lost its luster,\n    the fine gold become dull!\nThe sacred gems are scattered\n    at every street corner. How the precious children of Zion,\n    once worth their weight in gold,\nare now considered as pots of clay,\n    the work of a potter\u2019s hands! Even jackals offer their breasts\n    to nurse their young,\nbut my people have become heartless\n    like ostriches in the desert. Because of thirst the infant\u2019s tongue\n    sticks to the roof of its mouth;\nthe children beg for bread,\n    but no one gives it to them. Those who once ate delicacies\n    are destitute in the streets.\nThose brought up in royal purple\n    now lie on ash heaps. The punishment of my people\n    is greater than that of Sodom,\nwhich was overthrown in a moment\n    without a hand turned to help her. Their princes were brighter than snow\n    and whiter than milk,\ntheir bodies more ruddy than rubies,\n    their appearance like lapis lazuli. But now they are blacker than soot;\n    they are not recognized in the streets.\nTheir skin has shriveled on their bones;\n    it has become as dry as a stick. Those killed by the sword are better off\n    than those who die of famine;\nracked with hunger, they waste away\n    for lack of food from the field. With their own hands compassionate women\n    have cooked their own children,\nwho became their food\n    when my people were destroyed. The Lord has given full vent to his wrath;\n    he has poured out his fierce anger.\nHe kindled a fire in Zion\n    that consumed her foundations. The kings of the earth did not believe,\n    nor did any of the peoples of the world,\nthat enemies and foes could enter\n    the gates of Jerusalem. But it happened because of the sins of her prophets\n    and the iniquities of her priests,\nwho shed within her\n    the blood of the righteous. Now they grope through the streets\n    as if they were blind.\nThey are so defiled with blood\n    that no one dares to touch their garments. \u201cGo away! You are unclean!\u201d people cry to them.\n    \u201cAway! Away! Don\u2019t touch us!\u201d\nWhen they flee and wander about,\n    people among the nations say,\n    \u201cThey can stay here no longer.\u201d The Lord himself has scattered them;\n    he no longer watches over them.\nThe priests are shown no honor,\n    the elders no favor. Moreover, our eyes failed,\n    looking in vain for help;\nfrom our towers we watched\n    for a nation that could not save us. People stalked us at every step,\n    so we could not walk in our streets.\nOur end was near, our days were numbered,\n    for our end had come. Our pursuers were swifter\n    than eagles in the sky;\nthey chased us over the mountains\n    and lay in wait for us in the desert. The Lord\u2019s anointed, our very life breath,\n    was caught in their traps.\nWe thought that under his shadow\n    we would live among the nations. Rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom,\n    you who live in the land of Uz.\nBut to you also the cup will be passed;\n    you will be drunk and stripped naked. Your punishment will end, Daughter Zion;\n    he will not prolong your exile.\nBut he will punish your sin, Daughter Edom,\n    and expose your wickedness. \n\nRemember, Lord, what has happened to us;\n    look, and see our disgrace. Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,\n    our homes to foreigners. We have become fatherless,\n    our mothers are widows. We must buy the water we drink;\n    our wood can be had only at a price. Those who pursue us are at our heels;\n    we are weary and find no rest. We submitted to Egypt and Assyria\n    to get enough bread. Our ancestors sinned and are no more,\n    and we bear their punishment. Slaves rule over us,\n    and there is no one to free us from their hands. We get our bread at the risk of our lives\n    because of the sword in the desert. Our skin is hot as an oven,\n    feverish from hunger. Women have been violated in Zion,\n    and virgins in the towns of Judah. Princes have been hung up by their hands;\n    elders are shown no respect. Young men toil at the millstones;\n    boys stagger under loads of wood. The elders are gone from the city gate;\n    the young men have stopped their music. Joy is gone from our hearts;\n    our dancing has turned to mourning. The crown has fallen from our head.\n    Woe to us, for we have sinned! Because of this our hearts are faint,\n    because of these things our eyes grow dim for Mount Zion, which lies desolate,\n    with jackals prowling over it. You, Lord, reign forever;\n    your throne endures from generation to generation. Why do you always forget us?\n    Why do you forsake us so long? Restore us to yourself, Lord, that we may return;\n    renew our days as of old unless you have utterly rejected us\n    and are angry with us beyond measure. \n\n",
