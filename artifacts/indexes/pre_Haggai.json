You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.\u201d This is what the Lord Almighty says: \u201cGive careful thought to your ways. Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cYou expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?\u201d declares the Lord Almighty. \u201cBecause of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.\u201d Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord. Then Haggai, the Lord\u2019s messenger, gave this message of the Lord to the people: \u201cI am with you,\u201d declares the Lord. So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the Lord Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.\nIn the second year of King Darius, \n\non the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: \u201cSpeak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, \u2018Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? But now be strong, Zerubbabel,\u2019 declares the Lord. \u2018Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,\u2019 declares the Lord, \u2018and work. For I am with you,\u2019 declares the Lord Almighty. \u2018This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.\u2019 \u201cThis is what the Lord Almighty says: \u2018In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,\u2019 says the Lord Almighty. \u2018The silver is mine and the gold is mine,\u2019 declares the Lord Almighty. \u2018The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,\u2019 says the Lord Almighty. \u2018And in this place I will grant peace,\u2019 declares the Lord Almighty.\u201d On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai: \u201cThis is what the Lord Almighty says: \u2018Ask the priests what the law says: If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?\u2019\u201d\nThe priests answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Then Haggai said, \u201cIf a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the priests replied, \u201cit becomes defiled.\u201d Then Haggai said, \u201c\u2018So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,\u2019 declares the Lord. \u2018Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled. \u201c\u2018Now give careful thought to this from this day on\u2014consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord\u2019s temple. When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,\u2019 declares the Lord. \u2018From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord\u2019s temple was laid. Give careful thought: Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.\n\u201c\u2018From this day on I will bless you.\u2019\u201d The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: \u201cTell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother. \u201c\u2018On that day,\u2019 declares the Lord Almighty, \u2018I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,\u2019 declares the Lord, \u2018and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,\u2019 declares the Lord Almighty.\u201d \n\n",
