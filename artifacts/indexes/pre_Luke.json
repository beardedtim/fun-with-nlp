    "text": "Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord\u2019s commands and decrees blamelessly. But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old. Once when Zechariah\u2019s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. But the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous\u2014to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d Zechariah asked the angel, \u201cHow can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.\u201d The angel said to him, \u201cI am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.\u201d Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed, he returned home. After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. \u201cThe Lord has done this for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\u201d In the sixth month of Elizabeth\u2019s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin\u2019s name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, \u201cGreetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\u201d Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, \u201cDo not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob\u2019s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.\u201d \u201cHow will this be,\u201d Mary asked the angel, \u201csince I am a virgin?\u201d The angel answered, \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail.\u201d \u201cI am the Lord\u2019s servant,\u201d Mary answered. \u201cMay your word to me be fulfilled.\u201d Then the angel left her. At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah\u2019s home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary\u2019s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \u201cBlessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!\u201d And Mary said:\n\u201cMy soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful\n    of the humble state of his servant.\nFrom now on all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me\u2014\n    holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him,\n    from generation to generation. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;\n    he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones\n    but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things\n    but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel,\n    remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever,\n    just as he promised our ancestors.\u201d Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy. On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, \u201cNo! He is to be called John.\u201d They said to her, \u201cThere is no one among your relatives who has that name.\u201d Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, \u201cWhat then is this child going to be?\u201d For the Lord\u2019s hand was with him. His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: \u201cPraise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    because he has come to his people and redeemed them. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us\n    in the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), salvation from our enemies\n    and from the hand of all who hate us\u2014 to show mercy to our ancestors\n    and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,\n    and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;\n    for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation\n    through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God,\n    by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness\n    and in the shadow of death,\nto guide our feet into the path of peace.\u201d And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel. \n\nIn those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.\u201d Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, \u201cGlory to God in the highest heaven,\n    and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\u201d When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.\u201d So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, \u201cEvery firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord\u201d), and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: \u201ca pair of doves or two young pigeons.\u201d Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord\u2019s Messiah. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: \u201cSovereign Lord, as you have promised,\n    you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: a light for revelation to the Gentiles,\n    and the glory of your people Israel.\u201d The child\u2019s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: \u201cThis child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\u201d There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him. Every year Jesus\u2019 parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, \u201cSon, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\u201d \u201cWhy were you searching for me?\u201d he asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know I had to be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d But they did not understand what he was saying to them. Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. \n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\u2014when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene\u2014 during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:\n\u201cA voice of one calling in the wilderness,\n\u2018Prepare the way for the Lord,\n    make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in,\n    every mountain and hill made low.\nThe crooked roads shall become straight,\n    the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God\u2019s salvation.\u2019\u201d John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, \u201cYou brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, \u2018We have Abraham as our father.\u2019 For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do then?\u201d the crowd asked. John answered, \u201cAnyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.\u201d Even tax collectors came to be baptized. \u201cTeacher,\u201d they asked, \u201cwhat should we do?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t collect any more than you are required to,\u201d he told them. Then some soldiers asked him, \u201cAnd what should we do?\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cDon\u2019t extort money and don\u2019t accuse people falsely\u2014be content with your pay.\u201d The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. John answered them all, \u201cI baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\u201d And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them. But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother\u2019s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison. When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: \u201cYou are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\u201d Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph,\nthe son of Heli, the son of Matthat,\nthe son of Levi, the son of Melki,\nthe son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos,\nthe son of Nahum, the son of Esli,\nthe son of Naggai, the son of Maath,\nthe son of Mattathias, the son of Semein,\nthe son of Josek, the son of Joda, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa,\nthe son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,\nthe son of Neri, the son of Melki,\nthe son of Addi, the son of Cosam,\nthe son of Elmadam, the son of Er, the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer,\nthe son of Jorim, the son of Matthat,\nthe son of Levi, the son of Simeon,\nthe son of Judah, the son of Joseph,\nthe son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menna,\nthe son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan,\nthe son of David, the son of Jesse,\nthe son of Obed, the son of Boaz,\nthe son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram,\nthe son of Hezron, the son of Perez,\nthe son of Judah, the son of Jacob,\nthe son of Isaac, the son of Abraham,\nthe son of Terah, the son of Nahor, the son of Serug, the son of Reu,\nthe son of Peleg, the son of Eber,\nthe son of Shelah, the son of Cainan,\nthe son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem,\nthe son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,\nthe son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,\nthe son of Kenan, the son of Enosh,\nthe son of Seth, the son of Adam,\nthe son of God. \n\nJesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. The devil said to him, \u201cIf you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone.\u2019\u201d The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, \u201cI will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be yours.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIt is written: \u2018Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.\u2019\u201d The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. \u201cIf you are the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201cthrow yourself down from here. For it is written:\n\u201c\u2018He will command his angels concerning you\n    to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands,\n    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\u2019\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIt is said: \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is on me,\n    because he has anointed me\n    to proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners\n    and recovery of sight for the blind,\nto set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor.\u201d Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \u201cToday this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u201d All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \u201cIsn\u2019t this Joseph\u2019s son?\u201d they asked. Jesus said to them, \u201cSurely you will quote this proverb to me: \u2018Physician, heal yourself!\u2019 And you will tell me, \u2018Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.\u2019\u201d \u201cTruly I tell you,\u201d he continued, \u201cno prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah\u2019s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed\u2014only Naaman the Syrian.\u201d All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, \u201cGo away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are\u2014the Holy One of God!\u201d \u201cBe quiet!\u201d Jesus said sternly. \u201cCome out of him!\u201d Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. All the people were amazed and said to each other, \u201cWhat words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!\u201d And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon\u2019s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah. At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. But he said, \u201cI must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u201d And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. \n\nOne day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. He saw at the water\u2019s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \u201cPut out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.\u201d Simon answered, \u201cMaster, we\u2019ve worked hard all night and haven\u2019t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\u201d When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus\u2019 knees and said, \u201cGo away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\u201d For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon\u2019s partners.\nThen Jesus said to Simon, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.\u201d So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, \u201cLord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\u201d Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \u201cI am willing,\u201d he said. \u201cBe clean!\u201d And immediately the leprosy left him. Then Jesus ordered him, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\u201d Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. When Jesus saw their faith, he said, \u201cFriend, your sins are forgiven.\u201d The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, \u201cWho is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\u201d Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, \u201cWhy are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, \u2018Your sins are forgiven,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d So he said to the paralyzed man, \u201cI tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\u201d Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, \u201cWe have seen remarkable things today.\u201d After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. \u201cFollow me,\u201d Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, \u201cWhy do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\u201d Jesus answered them, \u201cIt is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d They said to him, \u201cJohn\u2019s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cCan you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.\u201d He told them this parable: \u201cNo one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, \u2018The old is better.\u2019\u201d \n\nOne Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. Some of the Pharisees asked, \u201cWhy are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\u201d Jesus answered them, \u201cHave you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\u201d Then Jesus said to them, \u201cThe Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, \u201cGet up and stand in front of everyone.\u201d So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, \u201cI ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?\u201d He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d He did so, and his hand was completely restored. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all. Looking at his disciples, he said:\n\u201cBlessed are you who are poor,\n    for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now,\n    for you will be satisfied.\nBlessed are you who weep now,\n    for you will laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you,\n    when they exclude you and insult you\n    and reject your name as evil,\n        because of the Son of Man. \u201cRejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets. \u201cBut woe to you who are rich,\n    for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now,\n    for you will go hungry.\nWoe to you who laugh now,\n    for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you,\n    for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets. \u201cBut to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you. \u201cIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. \u201cDo not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d He also told them this parable: \u201cCan the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher. \u201cWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, \u2018Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,\u2019 when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye. \u201cNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. \u201cWhy do you call me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\u201d \n\nWhen Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. There a centurion\u2019s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \u201cThis man deserves to have you do this, because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\u201d So Jesus went with them.\nHe was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \u201cLord, don\u2019t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, \u2018Go,\u2019 and he goes; and that one, \u2018Come,\u2019 and he comes. I say to my servant, \u2018Do this,\u2019 and he does it.\u201d When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \u201cI tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\u201d Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out\u2014the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, \u201cYoung man, I say to you, get up!\u201d The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God. \u201cA great prophet has appeared among us,\u201d they said. \u201cGod has come to help his people.\u201d This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. John\u2019s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, \u201cAre you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\u201d When the men came to Jesus, they said, \u201cJohn the Baptist sent us to you to ask, \u2018Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\u2019\u201d At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. So he replied to the messengers, \u201cGo back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\u201d After John\u2019s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:\n\u201c\u2018I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way before you.\u2019 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\u201d (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus\u2019 words, acknowledged that God\u2019s way was right, because they had been baptized by John. But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God\u2019s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) Jesus went on to say, \u201cTo what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other:\n\u201c\u2018We played the pipe for you,\n    and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge,\n    and you did not cry.\u2019 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, \u2018He has a demon.\u2019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, \u2018Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u2019 But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\u201d When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee\u2019s house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee\u2019s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \u201cIf this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is\u2014that she is a sinner.\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cSimon, I have something to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cTell me, teacher,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\u201d Simon replied, \u201cI suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.\u201d\n\u201cYou have judged correctly,\u201d Jesus said. Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \u201cDo you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven\u2014as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.\u201d Then Jesus said to her, \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d The other guests began to say among themselves, \u201cWho is this who even forgives sins?\u201d Jesus said to the woman, \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d \n\nAfter this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod\u2019s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: \u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\u201d\nWhen he said this, he called out, \u201cWhoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\u201d His disciples asked him what this parable meant. He said, \u201cThe knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,\n\u201c\u2018though seeing, they may not see;\n    though hearing, they may not understand.\u2019 \u201cThis is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life\u2019s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. \u201cNo one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.\u201d Now Jesus\u2019 mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. Someone told him, \u201cYour mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\u201d He replied, \u201cMy mother and brothers are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u201d One day Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cLet us go over to the other side of the lake.\u201d So they got into a boat and set out. As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \u201cMaster, Master, we\u2019re going to drown!\u201d\nHe got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d he asked his disciples.\nIn fear and amazement they asked one another, \u201cWho is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\u201d They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \u201cWhat do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don\u2019t torture me!\u201d For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. Jesus asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cLegion,\u201d he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus\u2019 feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, \u201cReturn home and tell how much God has done for you.\u201d So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus\u2019 feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.\nAs Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. \u201cWho touched me?\u201d Jesus asked.\nWhen they all denied it, Peter said, \u201cMaster, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\u201d But Jesus said, \u201cSomeone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\u201d Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, \u201cDaughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\u201d While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. \u201cYour daughter is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t bother the teacher anymore.\u201d Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\u201d When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child\u2019s father and mother. Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \u201cStop wailing,\u201d Jesus said. \u201cShe is not dead but asleep.\u201d They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But he took her by the hand and said, \u201cMy child, get up!\u201d Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. \n\nWhen Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He told them: \u201cTake nothing for the journey\u2014no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere. Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. But Herod said, \u201cI beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?\u201d And he tried to see him. When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, \u201cSend the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.\u201d He replied, \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d\nThey answered, \u201cWe have only five loaves of bread and two fish\u2014unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.\u201d (About five thousand men were there.)\nBut he said to his disciples, \u201cHave them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, \u201cWho do the crowds say I am?\u201d They replied, \u201cSome say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.\u201d \u201cBut what about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho do you say I am?\u201d\nPeter answered, \u201cGod\u2019s Messiah.\u201d Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, \u201cThe Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\u201d Then he said to them all: \u201cWhoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. \u201cTruly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u201d About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, \u201cMaster, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters\u2014one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u201d (He did not know what he was saying.) While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. A voice came from the cloud, saying, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.\u201d When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen. The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. A man in the crowd called out, \u201cTeacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.\u201d \u201cYou unbelieving and perverse generation,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201chow long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.\u201d Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\nWhile everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, \u201cListen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.\u201d But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. Then he said to them, \u201cWhoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.\u201d \u201cMaster,\u201d said John, \u201cwe saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.\u201d \u201cDo not stop him,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cfor whoever is not against you is for you.\u201d As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, \u201cLord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?\u201d But Jesus turned and rebuked them. Then he and his disciples went to another village. As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, \u201cI will follow you wherever you go.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cFoxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\u201d He said to another man, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\nBut he replied, \u201cLord, first let me go and bury my father.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u201d Still another said, \u201cI will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cNo one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\u201d \n\nAfter this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. He told them, \u201cThe harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. \u201cWhen you enter a house, first say, \u2018Peace to this house.\u2019 If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. \u201cWhen you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, \u2018The kingdom of God has come near to you.\u2019 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, \u2018Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.\u2019 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. \u201cWoe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. \u201cWhoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.\u201d The seventy-two returned with joy and said, \u201cLord, even the demons submit to us in your name.\u201d He replied, \u201cI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\u201d At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, \u201cI praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. \u201cAll things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u201d Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, \u201cBlessed are the eyes that see what you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\u201d On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \u201cTeacher,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d \u201cWhat is written in the Law?\u201d he replied. \u201cHow do you read it?\u201d He answered, \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind\u2019; and, \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou have answered correctly,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cDo this and you will live.\u201d But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \u201cAnd who is my neighbor?\u201d In reply Jesus said: \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. \u2018Look after him,\u2019 he said, \u2018and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.\u2019 \u201cWhich of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\u201d The expert in the law replied, \u201cThe one who had mercy on him.\u201d\nJesus told him, \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord\u2019s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \u201cLord, don\u2019t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\u201d \u201cMartha, Martha,\u201d the Lord answered, \u201cyou are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed\u2014or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\u201d \n\nOne day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, \u201cLord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.\u201d He said to them, \u201cWhen you pray, say:\n\u201c\u2018Father,\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins,\n    for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.\nAnd lead us not into temptation.\u2019\u201d Then Jesus said to them, \u201cSuppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, \u2018Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.\u2019 And suppose the one inside answers, \u2018Don\u2019t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can\u2019t get up and give you anything.\u2019 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. \u201cSo I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. \u201cWhich of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. But some of them said, \u201cBy Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.\u201d Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: \u201cAny kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. \u201cWhen a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder. \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. \u201cWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, \u2018I will return to the house I left.\u2019 When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.\u201d As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, \u201cBlessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\u201d He replied, \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\u201d As the crowds increased, Jesus said, \u201cThis is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here. \u201cNo one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.\u201d When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. Then the Lord said to him, \u201cNow then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? But now as for what is inside you\u2014be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. \u201cWoe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone. \u201cWoe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces. \u201cWoe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.\u201d One of the experts in the law answered him, \u201cTeacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cAnd you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them. \u201cWoe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them. So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. Because of this, God in his wisdom said, \u2018I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.\u2019 Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all. \u201cWoe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.\u201d When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, waiting to catch him in something he might say. \n\nMeanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: \u201cBe on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. \u201cI tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cI tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. \u201cWhen you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.\u201d Someone in the crowd said to him, \u201cTeacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cMan, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?\u201d Then he said to them, \u201cWatch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.\u201d And he told them this parable: \u201cThe ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, \u2018What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.\u2019 \u201cThen he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I\u2019ll say to myself, \u201cYou have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\u201d\u2019 \u201cBut God said to him, \u2018You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?\u2019 \u201cThis is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.\u201d Then Jesus said to his disciples: \u201cTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? \u201cConsider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you\u2014you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. \u201cDo not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \u201cBe dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\u201d Peter asked, \u201cLord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\u201d The Lord answered, \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose the servant says to himself, \u2018My master is taking a long time in coming,\u2019 and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. \u201cThe servant who knows the master\u2019s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. \u201cI have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed! Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\u201d He said to the crowd: \u201cWhen you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, \u2018It\u2019s going to rain,\u2019 and it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, \u2018It\u2019s going to be hot,\u2019 and it is. Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don\u2019t know how to interpret this present time? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you judge for yourselves what is right? As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.\u201d \n\nNow there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\u201d Then he told this parable: \u201cA man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, \u2018For three years now I\u2019ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven\u2019t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Sir,\u2019 the man replied, \u2018leave it alone for one more year, and I\u2019ll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.\u2019\u201d On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, \u201cWoman, you are set free from your infirmity.\u201d Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, \u201cThere are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.\u201d The Lord answered him, \u201cYou hypocrites! Doesn\u2019t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\u201d When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. Then Jesus asked, \u201cWhat is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.\u201d Again he asked, \u201cWhat shall I compare the kingdom of God to? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\u201d Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. Someone asked him, \u201cLord, are only a few people going to be saved?\u201d\nHe said to them, \u201cMake every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, \u2018Sir, open the door for us.\u2019\n\u201cBut he will answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know you or where you come from.\u2019 \u201cThen you will say, \u2018We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.\u2019 \u201cBut he will reply, \u2018I don\u2019t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!\u2019 \u201cThere will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.\u201d At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, \u201cLeave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.\u201d He replied, \u201cGo tell that fox, \u2018I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.\u2019 In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day\u2014for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! \u201cJerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, \u2018Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d \n\nOne Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?\u201d But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way. Then he asked them, \u201cIf one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?\u201d And they had nothing to say. When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: \u201cWhen someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, \u2018Give this person your seat.\u2019 Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, \u2018Friend, move up to a better place.\u2019 Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d Then Jesus said to his host, \u201cWhen you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, \u201cBlessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.\u201d Jesus replied: \u201cA certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, \u2018Come, for everything is now ready.\u2019 \u201cBut they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, \u2018I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.\u2019 \u201cAnother said, \u2018I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I\u2019m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.\u2019 \u201cStill another said, \u2018I just got married, so I can\u2019t come.\u2019 \u201cThe servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, \u2018Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Sir,\u2019 the servant said, \u2018what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.\u2019 \u201cThen the master told his servant, \u2018Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.\u2019\u201d Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: \u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters\u2014yes, even their own life\u2014such a person cannot be my disciple. And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. \u201cSuppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won\u2019t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, \u2018This person began to build and wasn\u2019t able to finish.\u2019 \u201cOr suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won\u2019t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. \u201cSalt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.\n\u201cWhoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\u201d \n\nNow the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, \u201cThis man welcomes sinners and eats with them.\u201d Then Jesus told them this parable: \u201cSuppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, \u2018Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.\u2019 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent. \u201cOr suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn\u2019t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, \u2018Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.\u2019 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\u201d Jesus continued: \u201cThere was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, \u2018Father, give me my share of the estate.\u2019 So he divided his property between them. \u201cNot long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. \u201cWhen he came to his senses, he said, \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.\u2019 So he got up and went to his father.\n\u201cBut while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. \u201cThe son said to him, \u2018Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\u2019 \u201cBut the father said to his servants, \u2018Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let\u2019s have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019 So they began to celebrate. \u201cMeanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. \u2018Your brother has come,\u2019 he replied, \u2018and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.\u2019 \u201cThe older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, \u2018Look! All these years I\u2019ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!\u2019 \u201c\u2018My son,\u2019 the father said, \u2018you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019\u201d \n\nJesus told his disciples: \u201cThere was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. So he called him in and asked him, \u2018What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.\u2019 \u201cThe manager said to himself, \u2018What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I\u2019m not strong enough to dig, and I\u2019m ashamed to beg\u2014 I know what I\u2019ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.\u2019 \u201cSo he called in each one of his master\u2019s debtors. He asked the first, \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,\u2019 he replied.\n\u201cThe manager told him, \u2018Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.\u2019 \u201cThen he asked the second, \u2018And how much do you owe?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018A thousand bushels of wheat,\u2019 he replied.\n\u201cHe told him, \u2018Take your bill and make it eight hundred.\u2019 \u201cThe master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. \u201cWhoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else\u2019s property, who will give you property of your own? \u201cNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\u201d The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. He said to them, \u201cYou are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God\u2019s sight. \u201cThe Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. \u201cAnyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. \u201cThere was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. \u201cThe time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham\u2019s side. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, \u2018Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.\u2019 \u201cBut Abraham replied, \u2018Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.\u2019 \u201cHe answered, \u2018Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\u2019 \u201cAbraham replied, \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.\u2019 \u201c\u2018No, father Abraham,\u2019 he said, \u2018but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.\u2019 \u201cHe said to him, \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d \n\nJesus said to his disciples: \u201cThings that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. So watch yourselves.\n\u201cIf your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying \u2018I repent,\u2019 you must forgive them.\u201d The apostles said to the Lord, \u201cIncrease our faith!\u201d He replied, \u201cIf you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. \u201cSuppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, \u2018Come along now and sit down to eat\u2019? Won\u2019t he rather say, \u2018Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink\u2019? Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, \u2018We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.\u2019\u201d Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, \u201cJesus, Master, have pity on us!\u201d When he saw them, he said, \u201cGo, show yourselves to the priests.\u201d And as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus\u2019 feet and thanked him\u2014and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, \u201cWere not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?\u201d Then he said to him, \u201cRise and go; your faith has made you well.\u201d Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, \u201cThe coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, \u2018Here it is,\u2019 or \u2018There it is,\u2019 because the kingdom of God is in your midst.\u201d Then he said to his disciples, \u201cThe time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, \u2018There he is!\u2019 or \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Do not go running off after them. For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. \u201cJust as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. \u201cIt was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. \u201cIt will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. Remember Lot\u2019s wife! Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it. I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.\u201d  \u201cWhere, Lord?\u201d they asked.\nHe replied, \u201cWhere there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.\u201d \n\nThen Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: \u201cIn a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, \u2018Grant me justice against my adversary.\u2019 \u201cFor some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, \u2018Even though I don\u2019t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won\u2019t eventually come and attack me!\u2019\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: \u201cTwo men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: \u2018God, I thank you that I am not like other people\u2014robbers, evildoers, adulterers\u2014or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\u2019 \u201cBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, \u2018God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u2019 \u201cI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, \u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\u201d A certain ruler asked him, \u201cGood teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d \u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cNo one is good\u2014except God alone. You know the commandments: \u2018You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.\u2019\u201d \u201cAll these I have kept since I was a boy,\u201d he said. When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \u201cYou still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\u201d When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, \u201cHow hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d Those who heard this asked, \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cWhat is impossible with man is possible with God.\u201d Peter said to him, \u201cWe have left all we had to follow you!\u201d \u201cTruly I tell you,\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cno one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.\u201d Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, \u201cWe are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.\u201d The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. They told him, \u201cJesus of Nazareth is passing by.\u201d He called out, \u201cJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\u201d Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \u201cSon of David, have mercy on me!\u201d Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d\n\u201cLord, I want to see,\u201d he replied. Jesus said to him, \u201cReceive your sight; your faith has healed you.\u201d Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God. \n\nJesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, \u201cZacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.\u201d So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to mutter, \u201cHe has gone to be the guest of a sinner.\u201d But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, \u201cLook, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cToday salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. He said: \u201cA man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. \u2018Put this money to work,\u2019 he said, \u2018until I come back.\u2019 \u201cBut his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, \u2018We don\u2019t want this man to be our king.\u2019 \u201cHe was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. \u201cThe first one came and said, \u2018Sir, your mina has earned ten more.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Well done, my good servant!\u2019 his master replied. \u2018Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.\u2019 \u201cThe second came and said, \u2018Sir, your mina has earned five more.\u2019 \u201cHis master answered, \u2018You take charge of five cities.\u2019 \u201cThen another servant came and said, \u2018Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.\u2019 \u201cHis master replied, \u2018I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow? Why then didn\u2019t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?\u2019 \u201cThen he said to those standing by, \u2018Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Sir,\u2019 they said, \u2018he already has ten!\u2019 \u201cHe replied, \u2018I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them\u2014bring them here and kill them in front of me.\u2019\u201d After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, \u201cGo to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 say, \u2018The Lord needs it.\u2019\u201d Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, \u201cWhy are you untying the colt?\u201d They replied, \u201cThe Lord needs it.\u201d They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen: \u201cBlessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d\n\u201cPeace in heaven and glory in the highest!\u201d Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, rebuke your disciples!\u201d \u201cI tell you,\u201d he replied, \u201cif they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.\u201d As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, \u201cIf you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace\u2014but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God\u2019s coming to you.\u201d When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. \u201cIt is written,\u201d he said to them, \u201c\u2018My house will be a house of prayer\u2019; but you have made it \u2018a den of robbers.\u2019\u201d Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words. \n\nOne day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. \u201cTell us by what authority you are doing these things,\u201d they said. \u201cWho gave you this authority?\u201d He replied, \u201cI will also ask you a question. Tell me: John\u2019s baptism\u2014was it from heaven, or of human origin?\u201d They discussed it among themselves and said, \u201cIf we say, \u2018From heaven,\u2019 he will ask, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u2019 But if we say, \u2018Of human origin,\u2019 all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.\u201d So they answered, \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it was from.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.\u201d He went on to tell the people this parable: \u201cA man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. \u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said, \u2018What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019 \u201cBut when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. \u2018This is the heir,\u2019 they said. \u2018Let\u2019s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n\u201cWhat then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u201d\nWhen the people heard this, they said, \u201cGod forbid!\u201d Jesus looked directly at them and asked, \u201cThen what is the meaning of that which is written:\n\u201c\u2018The stone the builders rejected\n    has become the cornerstone\u2019? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u201d The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. So the spies questioned him: \u201cTeacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\u201d He saw through their duplicity and said to them, \u201cShow me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?\u201d\n\u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d they replied. He said to them, \u201cThen give back to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s, and to God what is God\u2019s.\u201d They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. \u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cMoses wrote for us that if a man\u2019s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. The second and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. Finally, the woman died too. Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cThe people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God\u2019s children, since they are children of the resurrection. But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord \u2018the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\u2019 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.\u201d Some of the teachers of the law responded, \u201cWell said, teacher!\u201d And no one dared to ask him any more questions. Then Jesus said to them, \u201cWhy is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself declares in the Book of Psalms:\n\u201c\u2018The Lord said to my Lord:\n    \u201cSit at my right hand until I make your enemies\n    a footstool for your feet.\u201d\u2019 David calls him \u2018Lord.\u2019 How then can he be his son?\u201d While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cBeware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows\u2019 houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.\u201d \n\nAs Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. \u201cTruly I tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cthis poor widow has put in more than all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\u201d Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, \u201cAs for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.\u201d \u201cTeacher,\u201d they asked, \u201cwhen will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?\u201d He replied: \u201cWatch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, \u2018I am he,\u2019 and, \u2018The time is near.\u2019 Do not follow them. When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.\u201d Then he said to them: \u201cNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. \u201cBut before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. And so you will bear testimony to me. But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. Everyone will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. Stand firm, and you will win life. \u201cWhen you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. \u201cThere will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d He told them this parable: \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near. \u201cTruly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. \u201cBe careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple. \n\nNow the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \u201cGo and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\u201d \u201cWhere do you want us to prepare for it?\u201d they asked. He replied, \u201cAs you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, \u2018The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u2019 He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.\u201d They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, \u201cI have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\u201d After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u201cTake this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u201d And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!\u201d They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, \u201cThe kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \u201cSimon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.\u201d But he replied, \u201cLord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cI tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\u201d Then Jesus asked them, \u201cWhen I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d they answered. He said to them, \u201cBut now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don\u2019t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written: \u2018And he was numbered with the transgressors\u2019; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.\u201d The disciples said, \u201cSee, Lord, here are two swords.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d he replied. Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. On reaching the place, he said to them, \u201cPray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d He withdrew about a stone\u2019s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, \u201cFather, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\u201d An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. \u201cWhy are you sleeping?\u201d he asked them. \u201cGet up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus asked him, \u201cJudas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\u201d When Jesus\u2019 followers saw what was going to happen, they said, \u201cLord, should we strike with our swords?\u201d And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, \u201cNo more of this!\u201d And he touched the man\u2019s ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, \u201cAm I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour\u2014when darkness reigns.\u201d Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \u201cThis man was with him.\u201d But he denied it. \u201cWoman, I don\u2019t know him,\u201d he said. A little later someone else saw him and said, \u201cYou also are one of them.\u201d\n\u201cMan, I am not!\u201d Peter replied. About an hour later another asserted, \u201cCertainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\u201d Peter replied, \u201cMan, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \u201cBefore the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\u201d And he went outside and wept bitterly. The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. They blindfolded him and demanded, \u201cProphesy! Who hit you?\u201d And they said many other insulting things to him. At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. \u201cIf you are the Messiah,\u201d they said, \u201ctell us.\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cIf I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\u201d They all asked, \u201cAre you then the Son of God?\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cYou say that I am.\u201d Then they said, \u201cWhy do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.\u201d \n\nThen the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying, \u201cWe have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.\u201d So Pilate asked Jesus, \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d\n\u201cYou have said so,\u201d Jesus replied. Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, \u201cI find no basis for a charge against this man.\u201d But they insisted, \u201cHe stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.\u201d On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod\u2019s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day Herod and Pilate became friends\u2014before this they had been enemies. Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, and said to them, \u201cYou brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.\u201d  But the whole crowd shouted, \u201cAway with this man! Release Barabbas to us!\u201d (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. But they kept shouting, \u201cCrucify him! Crucify him!\u201d For the third time he spoke to them: \u201cWhy? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.\u201d But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. So Pilate decided to grant their demand. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will. As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, \u2018Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!\u2019 Then\n\u201c\u2018they will say to the mountains, \u201cFall on us!\u201d\n    and to the hills, \u201cCover us!\u201d\u2019 For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?\u201d Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals\u2014one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, \u201cHe saved others; let him save himself if he is God\u2019s Messiah, the Chosen One.\u201d The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, \u201cIf you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.\u201d There was a written notice above him, which read: this is the king of the jews. One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \u201cAren\u2019t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!\u201d But the other criminal rebuked him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fear God,\u201d he said, \u201csince you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\u201d Then he said, \u201cJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.\u201d It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit.\u201d When he had said this, he breathed his last. The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, \u201cSurely this was a righteous man.\u201d When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus\u2019 body. Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment. \n\nOn the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: \u2018The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.\u2019 \u201d Then they remembered his words. When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, \u201cWhat are you discussing together as you walk along?\u201d\nThey stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \u201cAre you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\u201d \u201cWhat things?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cAbout Jesus of Nazareth,\u201d they replied. \u201cHe was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn\u2019t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.\u201d He said to them, \u201cHow foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\u201d And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, \u201cStay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\u201d So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, \u201cWere not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\u201d They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together and saying, \u201cIt is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\u201d Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, \u201cWhy are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\u201d When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \u201cDo you have anything here to eat?\u201d They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence. He said to them, \u201cThis is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\u201d Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, \u201cThis is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\u201d When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. \n\n",
