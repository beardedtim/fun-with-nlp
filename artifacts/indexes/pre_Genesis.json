    "text": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and the darkness he called \u201cnight.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day. And God said, \u201cLet there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.\u201d So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault \u201csky.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the second day. And God said, \u201cLet the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\u201d And it was so. God called the dry ground \u201cland,\u201d and the gathered waters he called \u201cseas.\u201d And God saw that it was good. Then God said, \u201cLet the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\u201d And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the third day. And God said, \u201cLet there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.\u201d And it was so. God made two great lights\u2014the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the fourth day. And God said, \u201cLet the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.\u201d So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the fifth day. And God said, \u201cLet the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.\u201d And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d So God created mankind in his own image,\n    in the image of God he created them;\n    male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\u201d Then God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the sixth day. \n\nThus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground\u2014trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, \u201cYou are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.\u201d The Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.\nBut for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said,\n\u201cThis is now bone of my bones\n    and flesh of my flesh;\nshe shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019\n    for she was taken out of man.\u201d That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. \n\nNow the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, \u201cDid God really say, \u2018You must not eat from any tree in the garden\u2019?\u201d The woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, \u2018You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou will not certainly die,\u201d the serpent said to the woman. \u201cFor God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d He answered, \u201cI heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.\u201d And he said, \u201cWho told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\u201d The man said, \u201cThe woman you put here with me\u2014she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.\u201d Then the Lord God said to the woman, \u201cWhat is this you have done?\u201d\nThe woman said, \u201cThe serpent deceived me, and I ate.\u201d So the Lord God said to the serpent, \u201cBecause you have done this,\n\u201cCursed are you above all livestock\n    and all wild animals!\nYou will crawl on your belly\n    and you will eat dust\n    all the days of your life. And I will put enmity\n    between you and the woman,\n    and between your offspring and hers;\nhe will crush your head,\n    and you will strike his heel.\u201d To the woman he said,\n\u201cI will make your pains in childbearing very severe;\n    with painful labor you will give birth to children.\nYour desire will be for your husband,\n    and he will rule over you.\u201d To Adam he said, \u201cBecause you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, \u2018You must not eat from it,\u2019\n\u201cCursed is the ground because of you;\n    through painful toil you will eat food from it\n    all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you,\n    and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow\n    you will eat your food\nuntil you return to the ground,\n    since from it you were taken;\nfor dust you are\n    and to dust you will return.\u201d Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living. The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. And the Lord God said, \u201cThe man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\u201d So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life. \n\nAdam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, \u201cWith the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.\u201d Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.\nNow Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also brought an offering\u2014fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. Then the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.\u201d Now Cain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. Then the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhere is your brother Abel?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cWhat have you done? Listen! Your brother\u2019s blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother\u2019s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\u201d Cain said to the Lord, \u201cMy punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\u201d But the Lord said to him, \u201cNot so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.\u201d Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. So Cain went out from the Lord\u2019s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. His brother\u2019s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain\u2019s sister was Naamah. Lamech said to his wives,\n\u201cAdah and Zillah, listen to me;\n    wives of Lamech, hear my words.\nI have killed a man for wounding me,\n    a young man for injuring me. If Cain is avenged seven times,\n    then Lamech seventy-seven times.\u201d Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, \u201cGod has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.\u201d Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.\nAt that time people began to call on the name of the Lord. \n\nThis is the written account of Adam\u2019s family line.\nWhen God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God. He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them \u201cMankind\u201d when they were created. When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth. After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died. When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh. After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died. When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan. After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died. When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel. After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died. When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared. After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died. When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died. When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away. When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech. After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died. When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. He named him Noah and said, \u201cHe will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.\u201d After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died. After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth. \n\nWhen human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. Then the Lord said, \u201cMy Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.\u201d The Nephilim were on the earth in those days\u2014and also afterward\u2014when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, \u201cI will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created\u2014and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground\u2014for I regret that I have made them.\u201d But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. This is the account of Noah and his family.\nNoah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. Now the earth was corrupt in God\u2019s sight and was full of violence. God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, \u201cI am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark\u2014you and your sons and your wife and your sons\u2019 wives with you. You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\u201d Noah did everything just as God commanded him. \n\nThe Lord then said to Noah, \u201cGo into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.\u201d And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him. Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons\u2019 wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah\u2019s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month\u2014on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark. They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut him in. For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits. Every living thing that moved on land perished\u2014birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark. The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days. \n\nBut God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. By the first day of the first month of Noah\u2019s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. Then God said to Noah, \u201cCome out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you\u2014the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.\u201d So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons\u2019 wives. All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds\u2014everything that moves on land\u2014came out of the ark, one kind after another. Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: \u201cNever again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. \u201cAs long as the earth endures,\nseedtime and harvest,\ncold and heat,\nsummer and winter,\nday and night\nwill never cease.\u201d \n\nThen God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. \u201cBut you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being. \u201cWhoever sheds human blood,\n    by humans shall their blood be shed;\nfor in the image of God\n    has God made mankind. As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.\u201d Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: \u201cI now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every living creature that was with you\u2014the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you\u2014every living creature on earth. I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.\u201d And God said, \u201cThis is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.\u201d So God said to Noah, \u201cThis is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.\u201d The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth. Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside. But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father\u2019s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked. When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, he said,\n\u201cCursed be Canaan!\n    The lowest of slaves\n    will he be to his brothers.\u201d He also said,\n\u201cPraise be to the Lord, the God of Shem!\n    May Canaan be the slave of Shem. May God extend Japheth\u2019s territory;\n    may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,\n    and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.\u201d After the flood Noah lived 350 years. Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died. \n\nThis is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah\u2019s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood. The sons of Japheth:\nGomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras. The sons of Gomer:\nAshkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. The sons of Javan:\nElishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites. (From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.) The sons of Ham:\nCush, Egypt, Put and Canaan. The sons of Cush:\nSeba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka.\nThe sons of Raamah:\nSheba and Dedan. Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said, \u201cLike Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.\u201d The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar. From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah\u2014which is the great city. Egypt was the father of\nthe Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites. Canaan was the father of\nSidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.\nLater the Canaanite clans scattered and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha. These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber. The sons of Shem:\nElam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram. The sons of Aram:\nUz, Hul, Gether and Meshek. Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,\nand Shelah the father of Eber. Two sons were born to Eber:\nOne was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan. Joktan was the father of\nAlmodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country. These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. These are the clans of Noah\u2019s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood. \n\nNow the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. They said to each other, \u201cCome, let\u2019s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.\u201d They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, \u201cCome, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.\u201d But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, \u201cIf as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.\u201d So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel\u2014because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth. This is the account of Shem\u2019s family line.\nTwo years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad. And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters. When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah. And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber. And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg. And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters. When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu. And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters. When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug. And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters. When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor. And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters. When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah. And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters. After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. This is the account of Terah\u2019s family line.\nTerah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot. While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth. Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram\u2019s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor\u2019s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah. Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive. Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there. Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran. \n\nThe Lord had said to Abram, \u201cGo from your country, your people and your father\u2019s household to the land I will show you. \u201cI will make you into a great nation,\n    and I will bless you;\nI will make your name great,\n    and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you,\n    and whoever curses you I will curse;\nand all peoples on earth\n    will be blessed through you.\u201d So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran. He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. The Lord appeared to Abram and said, \u201cTo your offspring I will give this land.\u201d So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him. From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord. Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev. Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, \u201cI know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, \u2018This is his wife.\u2019 Then they will kill me but will let you live. Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.\u201d When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. And when Pharaoh\u2019s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram\u2019s wife Sarai. So Pharaoh summoned Abram. \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me she was your wife? Why did you say, \u2018She is my sister,\u2019 so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!\u201d Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had. \n\nSo Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the Lord. Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together. And quarreling arose between Abram\u2019s herders and Lot\u2019s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time. So Abram said to Lot, \u201cLet\u2019s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. Is not the whole land before you? Let\u2019s part company. If you go to the left, I\u2019ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I\u2019ll go to the left.\u201d Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the Lord. The Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, \u201cLook around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever. I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.\u201d So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the Lord. \n\nAt the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim, these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley). For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar. Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar\u2014four kings against five. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away. They also carried off Abram\u2019s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom. A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram. When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan. During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people. After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King\u2019s Valley). Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying,\n\u201cBlessed be Abram by God Most High,\n    Creator of heaven and earth. And praise be to God Most High,\n    who delivered your enemies into your hand.\u201d\nThen Abram gave him a tenth of everything. The king of Sodom said to Abram, \u201cGive me the people and keep the goods for yourself.\u201d But Abram said to the king of Sodom, \u201cWith raised hand I have sworn an oath to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, \u2018I made Abram rich.\u2019 I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me\u2014to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.\u201d \n\nAfter this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:\n\u201cDo not be afraid, Abram.\n    I am your shield,\n    your very great reward.\u201d But Abram said, \u201cSovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?\u201d And Abram said, \u201cYou have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.\u201d Then the word of the Lord came to him: \u201cThis man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.\u201d He took him outside and said, \u201cLook up at the sky and count the stars\u2014if indeed you can count them.\u201d Then he said to him, \u201cSo shall your offspring be.\u201d Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. He also said to him, \u201cI am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.\u201d But Abram said, \u201cSovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?\u201d So the Lord said to him, \u201cBring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.\u201d Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. Then the Lord said to him, \u201cKnow for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.\u201d When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, \u201cTo your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates\u2014 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.\u201d \n\nNow Sarai, Abram\u2019s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; so she said to Abram, \u201cThe Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.\u201d\nAbram agreed to what Sarai said. So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.\nWhen she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. Then Sarai said to Abram, \u201cYou are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.\u201d \u201cYour slave is in your hands,\u201d Abram said. \u201cDo with her whatever you think best.\u201d Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. And he said, \u201cHagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m running away from my mistress Sarai,\u201d she answered. Then the angel of the Lord told her, \u201cGo back to your mistress and submit to her.\u201d The angel added, \u201cI will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.\u201d The angel of the Lord also said to her:\n\u201cYou are now pregnant\n    and you will give birth to a son.\nYou shall name him Ishmael,\n    for the Lord has heard of your misery. He will be a wild donkey of a man;\n    his hand will be against everyone\n    and everyone\u2019s hand against him,\nand he will live in hostility\n    toward all his brothers.\u201d She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: \u201cYou are the God who sees me,\u201d for she said, \u201cI have now seen the One who sees me.\u201d That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael. \n\nWhen Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, \u201cI am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.\u201d Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, \u201cAs for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.\u201d Then God said to Abraham, \u201cAs for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come. This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner\u2014those who are not your offspring. Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.\u201d God also said to Abraham, \u201cAs for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.\u201d Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, \u201cWill a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?\u201d And Abraham said to God, \u201cIf only Ishmael might live under your blessing!\u201d Then God said, \u201cYes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.\u201d When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him. On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, and his son Ishmael was thirteen; Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day. And every male in Abraham\u2019s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him. \n\nThe Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. He said, \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by. Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way\u2014now that you have come to your servant.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d they answered, \u201cdo as you say.\u201d So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. \u201cQuick,\u201d he said, \u201cget three seahs of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.\u201d Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. \u201cWhere is your wife Sarah?\u201d they asked him.\n\u201cThere, in the tent,\u201d he said. Then one of them said, \u201cI will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.\u201d\nNow Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \u201cAfter I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?\u201d Then the Lord said to Abraham, \u201cWhy did Sarah laugh and say, \u2018Will I really have a child, now that I am old?\u2019 Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.\u201d Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, \u201cI did not laugh.\u201d\nBut he said, \u201cYes, you did laugh.\u201d When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. Then the Lord said, \u201cShall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.\u201d Then the Lord said, \u201cThe outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.\u201d The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord. Then Abraham approached him and said: \u201cWill you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing\u2014to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cIf I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\u201d Then Abraham spoke up again: \u201cNow that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?\u201d\n\u201cIf I find forty-five there,\u201d he said, \u201cI will not destroy it.\u201d Once again he spoke to him, \u201cWhat if only forty are found there?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFor the sake of forty, I will not do it.\u201d Then he said, \u201cMay the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cI will not do it if I find thirty there.\u201d Abraham said, \u201cNow that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFor the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.\u201d Then he said, \u201cMay the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cFor the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.\u201d When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home. \n\nThe two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. \u201cMy lords,\u201d he said, \u201cplease turn aside to your servant\u2019s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d they answered, \u201cwe will spend the night in the square.\u201d But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom\u2014both young and old\u2014surrounded the house. They called to Lot, \u201cWhere are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\u201d Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, \u201cNo, my friends. Don\u2019t do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don\u2019t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\u201d \u201cGet out of our way,\u201d they replied. \u201cThis fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We\u2019ll treat you worse than them.\u201d They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. The two men said to Lot, \u201cDo you have anyone else here\u2014sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\u201d So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \u201cHurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!\u201d But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \u201cHurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\u201d When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord was merciful to them. As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \u201cFlee for your lives! Don\u2019t look back, and don\u2019t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\u201d But Lot said to them, \u201cNo, my lords, please! Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can\u2019t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I\u2019ll die. Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it\u2014it is very small, isn\u2019t it? Then my life will be spared.\u201d He said to him, \u201cVery well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\u201d (That is why the town was called Zoar.) By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah\u2014from the Lord out of the heavens. Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities\u2014and also the vegetation in the land. But Lot\u2019s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. One day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cOur father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children\u2014as is the custom all over the earth. Let\u2019s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.\u201d That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cLast night I slept with my father. Let\u2019s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\u201d So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. So both of Lot\u2019s daughters became pregnant by their father. The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today. \n\nNow Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, \u201cShe is my sister.\u201d Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, \u201cYou are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.\u201d Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, \u201cLord, will you destroy an innocent nation? Did he not say to me, \u2018She is my sister,\u2019 and didn\u2019t she also say, \u2018He is my brother\u2019? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.\u201d Then God said to him in the dream, \u201cYes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. Now return the man\u2019s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.\u201d Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, \u201cWhat have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.\u201d And Abimelek asked Abraham, \u201cWhat was your reason for doing this?\u201d Abraham replied, \u201cI said to myself, \u2018There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.\u2019 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. And when God had me wander from my father\u2019s household, I said to her, \u2018This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, \u201cHe is my brother.\u201d\u2019\u201d Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. And Abimelek said, \u201cMy land is before you; live wherever you like.\u201d To Sarah he said, \u201cI am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.\u201d Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again, for the Lord had kept all the women in Abimelek\u2019s household from conceiving because of Abraham\u2019s wife Sarah. \n\nNow the Lord was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised. Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Sarah said, \u201cGod has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.\u201d And she added, \u201cWho would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.\u201d The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, and she said to Abraham, \u201cGet rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman\u2019s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.\u201d The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. But God said to him, \u201cDo not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.\u201d Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, \u201cI cannot watch the boy die.\u201d And as she sat there, she began to sob. God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \u201cWhat is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.\u201d Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, \u201cGod is with you in everything you do. Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.\u201d Abraham said, \u201cI swear it.\u201d Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek\u2019s servants had seized. But Abimelek said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.\u201d So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty. Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, and Abimelek asked Abraham, \u201cWhat is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?\u201d He replied, \u201cAccept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.\u201d So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there. After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God. And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time. \n\nSome time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, \u201cAbraham!\u201d\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he replied. Then God said, \u201cTake your son, your only son, whom you love\u2014Isaac\u2014and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.\u201d Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. He said to his servants, \u201cStay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.\u201d Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, \u201cFather?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my son?\u201d Abraham replied.\n\u201cThe fire and wood are here,\u201d Isaac said, \u201cbut where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\u201d Abraham answered, \u201cGod himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\u201d And the two of them went on together. When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, \u201cAbraham! Abraham!\u201d\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he replied. \u201cDo not lay a hand on the boy,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.\u201d Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is said, \u201cOn the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.\u201d The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time and said, \u201cI swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.\u201d Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. Some time later Abraham was told, \u201cMilkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.\u201d Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham\u2019s brother Nahor. His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah. \n\nSarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said, \u201cI am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.\u201d The Hittites replied to Abraham, \u201cSir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.\u201d Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. He said to them, \u201cIf you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.\u201d Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d he said. \u201cListen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.\u201d Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land and he said to Ephron in their hearing, \u201cListen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.\u201d Ephron answered Abraham, \u201cListen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.\u201d Abraham agreed to Ephron\u2019s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. So Ephron\u2019s field in Machpelah near Mamre\u2014both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field\u2014was deeded to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site. \n\nAbraham was now very old, and the Lord had blessed him in every way. He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, \u201cPut your hand under my thigh. I want you to swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.\u201d The servant asked him, \u201cWhat if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?\u201d \u201cMake sure that you do not take my son back there,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cThe Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father\u2019s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, \u2018To your offspring I will give this land\u2019\u2014he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.\u201d So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master\u2019s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor. He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. Then he prayed, \u201cLord, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. May it be that when I say to a young woman, \u2018Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,\u2019 and she says, \u2018Drink, and I\u2019ll water your camels too\u2019\u2014let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.\u201d Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham\u2019s brother Nahor. The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. The servant hurried to meet her and said, \u201cPlease give me a little water from your jar.\u201d \u201cDrink, my lord,\u201d she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. After she had given him a drink, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.\u201d So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful. When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. Then he asked, \u201cWhose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father\u2019s house for us to spend the night?\u201d She answered him, \u201cI am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.\u201d And she added, \u201cWe have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.\u201d Then the man bowed down and worshiped the Lord, saying, \u201cPraise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my master\u2019s relatives.\u201d The young woman ran and told her mother\u2019s household about these things. Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister\u2019s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. \u201cCome, you who are blessed by the Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\u201d So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. Then food was set before him, but he said, \u201cI will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.\u201d\n\u201cThen tell us,\u201d Laban said. So he said, \u201cI am Abraham\u2019s servant. The Lord has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. My master\u2019s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. And my master made me swear an oath, and said, \u2018You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, but go to my father\u2019s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.\u2019 \u201cThen I asked my master, \u2018What if the woman will not come back with me?\u2019 \u201cHe replied, \u2018The Lord, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father\u2019s family. You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you\u2014then you will be released from my oath.\u2019 \u201cWhen I came to the spring today, I said, \u2018Lord, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, \u201cPlease let me drink a little water from your jar,\u201d and if she says to me, \u201cDrink, and I\u2019ll draw water for your camels too,\u201d let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master\u2019s son.\u2019 \u201cBefore I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, \u2018Please give me a drink.\u2019 \u201cShe quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, \u2018Drink, and I\u2019ll water your camels too.\u2019 So I drank, and she watered the camels also. \u201cI asked her, \u2018Whose daughter are you?\u2019\n\u201cShe said, \u2018The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.\u2019\n\u201cThen I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, and I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master\u2019s brother for his son. Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.\u201d Laban and Bethuel answered, \u201cThis is from the Lord; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master\u2019s son, as the Lord has directed.\u201d When Abraham\u2019s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord. Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.\nWhen they got up the next morning, he said, \u201cSend me on my way to my master.\u201d But her brother and her mother replied, \u201cLet the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.\u201d But he said to them, \u201cDo not detain me, now that the Lord has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.\u201d Then they said, \u201cLet\u2019s call the young woman and ask her about it.\u201d So they called Rebekah and asked her, \u201cWill you go with this man?\u201d\n\u201cI will go,\u201d she said. So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham\u2019s servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,\n\u201cOur sister, may you increase\n    to thousands upon thousands;\nmay your offspring possess\n    the cities of their enemies.\u201d Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel and asked the servant, \u201cWho is that man in the field coming to meet us?\u201d\n\u201cHe is my master,\u201d the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother\u2019s death. \n\nAbraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah. She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites. The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east. Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years. Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people. His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah. After Abraham\u2019s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi. This is the account of the family line of Abraham\u2019s son Ishmael, whom Sarah\u2019s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham. These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps. Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people. His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward all the tribes related to them. This is the account of the family line of Abraham\u2019s son Isaac.\nAbraham became the father of Isaac, and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, \u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d So she went to inquire of the Lord. The Lord said to her,\n\u201cTwo nations are in your womb,\n    and two peoples from within you will be separated;\none people will be stronger than the other,\n    and the older will serve the younger.\u201d When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau. After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau\u2019s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob. Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. He said to Jacob, \u201cQuick, let me have some of that red stew! I\u2019m famished!\u201d (That is why he was also called Edom.) Jacob replied, \u201cFirst sell me your birthright.\u201d \u201cLook, I am about to die,\u201d Esau said. \u201cWhat good is the birthright to me?\u201d But Jacob said, \u201cSwear to me first.\u201d So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.\nSo Esau despised his birthright. \n\nNow there was a famine in the land\u2014besides the previous famine in Abraham\u2019s time\u2014and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, \u201cDo not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.\u201d So Isaac stayed in Gerar. When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, \u201cShe is my sister,\u201d because he was afraid to say, \u201cShe is my wife.\u201d He thought, \u201cThe men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.\u201d When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, \u201cShe is really your wife! Why did you say, \u2018She is my sister\u2019?\u201d\nIsaac answered him, \u201cBecause I thought I might lose my life on account of her.\u201d Then Abimelek said, \u201cWhat is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.\u201d So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: \u201cAnyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\u201d Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him. The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. So all the wells that his father\u2019s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. Then Abimelek said to Isaac, \u201cMove away from us; you have become too powerful for us.\u201d So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled. Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. Isaac\u2019s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, \u201cThe water is ours!\u201d So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him. Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, \u201cNow the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.\u201d From there he went up to Beersheba. That night the Lord appeared to him and said, \u201cI am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.\u201d Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. Isaac asked them, \u201cWhy have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe saw clearly that the Lord was with you; so we said, \u2018There ought to be a sworn agreement between us\u2019\u2014between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the Lord.\u201d Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully. That day Isaac\u2019s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, \u201cWe\u2019ve found water!\u201d He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba. When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah. \n\nWhen Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, \u201cMy son.\u201d\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he answered. Isaac said, \u201cI am now an old man and don\u2019t know the day of my death. Now then, get your equipment\u2014your quiver and bow\u2014and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.\u201d Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \u201cLook, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, \u2018Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.\u2019 Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.\u201d Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, \u201cBut my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.\u201d His mother said to him, \u201cMy son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.\u201d So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. He went to his father and said, \u201cMy father.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my son,\u201d he answered. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Jacob said to his father, \u201cI am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.\u201d Isaac asked his son, \u201cHow did you find it so quickly, my son?\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord your God gave me success,\u201d he replied. Then Isaac said to Jacob, \u201cCome near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.\u201d Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, \u201cThe voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. \u201cAre you really my son Esau?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI am,\u201d he replied. Then he said, \u201cMy son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.\u201d\nJacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, \u201cCome here, my son, and kiss me.\u201d So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,\n\u201cAh, the smell of my son\n    is like the smell of a field\n    that the Lord has blessed. May God give you heaven\u2019s dew\n    and earth\u2019s richness\u2014\n    an abundance of grain and new wine. May nations serve you\n    and peoples bow down to you.\nBe lord over your brothers,\n    and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.\nMay those who curse you be cursed\n    and those who bless you be blessed.\u201d After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father\u2019s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, \u201cMy father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.\u201d His father Isaac asked him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cI am your son,\u201d he answered, \u201cyour firstborn, Esau.\u201d Isaac trembled violently and said, \u201cWho was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him\u2014and indeed he will be blessed!\u201d When Esau heard his father\u2019s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, \u201cBless me\u2014me too, my father!\u201d But he said, \u201cYour brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.\u201d Esau said, \u201cIsn\u2019t he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he\u2019s taken my blessing!\u201d Then he asked, \u201cHaven\u2019t you reserved any blessing for me?\u201d Isaac answered Esau, \u201cI have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?\u201d Esau said to his father, \u201cDo you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!\u201d Then Esau wept aloud. His father Isaac answered him,\n\u201cYour dwelling will be\n    away from the earth\u2019s richness,\n    away from the dew of heaven above. You will live by the sword\n    and you will serve your brother.\nBut when you grow restless,\n    you will throw his yoke\n    from off your neck.\u201d Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, \u201cThe days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\u201d When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, \u201cYour brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. Stay with him for a while until your brother\u2019s fury subsides. When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I\u2019ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?\u201d Then Rebekah said to Isaac, \u201cI\u2019m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.\u201d \n\nSo Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: \u201cDo not marry a Canaanite woman. Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother\u2019s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother\u2019s brother. May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.\u201d Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, \u201cDo not marry a Canaanite woman,\u201d and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. There above it stood the Lord, and he said: \u201cI am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\u201d When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, \u201cSurely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.\u201d He was afraid and said, \u201cHow awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.\u201d Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, \u201cIf God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear so that I return safely to my father\u2019s household, then the Lord will be my God and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God\u2019s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.\u201d \n\nThen Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples. There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large. When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well\u2019s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. Jacob asked the shepherds, \u201cMy brothers, where are you from?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Harran,\u201d they replied. He said to them, \u201cDo you know Laban, Nahor\u2019s grandson?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we know him,\u201d they answered. Then Jacob asked them, \u201cIs he well?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he is,\u201d they said, \u201cand here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthe sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d they replied, \u201cuntil all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.\u201d While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father\u2019s sheep, for she was a shepherd. When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban\u2019s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle\u2019s sheep. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father. As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister\u2019s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things. Then Laban said to him, \u201cYou are my own flesh and blood.\u201d\nAfter Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month, Laban said to him, \u201cJust because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.\u201d Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, \u201cI\u2019ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.\u201d Laban said, \u201cIt\u2019s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.\u201d So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her. Then Jacob said to Laban, \u201cGive me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.\u201d So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her. And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant. When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, \u201cWhat is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn\u2019t I? Why have you deceived me?\u201d Laban replied, \u201cIt is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. Finish this daughter\u2019s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.\u201d And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant. Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years. When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless. Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, \u201cIt is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.\u201d She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, \u201cBecause the Lord heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.\u201d So she named him Simeon. Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, \u201cNow at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.\u201d So he was named Levi. She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, \u201cThis time I will praise the Lord.\u201d So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children. \n\nWhen Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, \u201cGive me children, or I\u2019ll die!\u201d Jacob became angry with her and said, \u201cAm I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?\u201d Then she said, \u201cHere is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.\u201d So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her, and she became pregnant and bore him a son. Then Rachel said, \u201cGod has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.\u201d Because of this she named him Dan. Rachel\u2019s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. Then Rachel said, \u201cI have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.\u201d So she named him Naphtali. When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. Leah\u2019s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. Then Leah said, \u201cWhat good fortune!\u201d So she named him Gad. Leah\u2019s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. Then Leah said, \u201cHow happy I am! The women will call me happy.\u201d So she named him Asher. During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, \u201cPlease give me some of your son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d But she said to her, \u201cWasn\u2019t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son\u2019s mandrakes too?\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Rachel said, \u201che can sleep with you tonight in return for your son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. \u201cYou must sleep with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have hired you with my son\u2019s mandrakes.\u201d So he slept with her that night. God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. Then Leah said, \u201cGod has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.\u201d So she named him Issachar. Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. Then Leah said, \u201cGod has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.\u201d So she named him Zebulun. Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, \u201cGod has taken away my disgrace.\u201d She named him Joseph, and said, \u201cMay the Lord add to me another son.\u201d After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \u201cSend me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland. Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d But Laban said to him, \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.\u201d He added, \u201cName your wages, and I will pay them.\u201d Jacob said to him, \u201cYou know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care. The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?\u201d \u201cWhat shall I give you?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me anything,\u201d Jacob replied. \u201cBut if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.\u201d \u201cAgreed,\u201d said Laban. \u201cLet it be as you have said.\u201d That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban\u2019s flocks. Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban\u2019s animals. Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys. \n\nJacob heard that Laban\u2019s sons were saying, \u201cJacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.\u201d And Jacob noticed that Laban\u2019s attitude toward him was not what it had been. Then the Lord said to Jacob, \u201cGo back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.\u201d So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were. He said to them, \u201cI see that your father\u2019s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me. You know that I\u2019ve worked for your father with all my strength, yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me. If he said, \u2018The speckled ones will be your wages,\u2019 then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, \u2018The streaked ones will be your wages,\u2019 then all the flocks bore streaked young. So God has taken away your father\u2019s livestock and has given them to me. \u201cIn breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. The angel of God said to me in the dream, \u2018Jacob.\u2019 I answered, \u2018Here I am.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.\u2019\u201d Then Rachel and Leah replied, \u201cDo we still have any share in the inheritance of our father\u2019s estate? Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us. Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.\u201d Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels, and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father\u2019s household gods. Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away. So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled. Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, \u201cBe careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.\u201d Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too. Then Laban said to Jacob, \u201cWhat have you done? You\u2019ve deceived me, and you\u2019ve carried off my daughters like captives in war. Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn\u2019t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps? You didn\u2019t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing. I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, \u2018Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.\u2019 Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father\u2019s household. But why did you steal my gods?\u201d Jacob answered Laban, \u201cI was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.\u201d Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods. So Laban went into Jacob\u2019s tent and into Leah\u2019s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah\u2019s tent, he entered Rachel\u2019s tent. Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel\u2019s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. Rachel said to her father, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I\u2019m having my period.\u201d So he searched but could not find the household gods. Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. \u201cWhat is my crime?\u201d he asked Laban. \u201cHow have I wronged you that you hunt me down? Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us. \u201cI have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks. I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night. This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes. It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.\u201d Laban answered Jacob, \u201cThe women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne? Come now, let\u2019s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.\u201d So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. He said to his relatives, \u201cGather some stones.\u201d So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap. Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. Laban said, \u201cThis heap is a witness between you and me today.\u201d That is why it was called Galeed. It was also called Mizpah, because he said, \u201cMay the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other. If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.\u201d Laban also said to Jacob, \u201cHere is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me. This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me. May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\u201d\nSo Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac. He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there. Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home. \n\nJacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. When Jacob saw them, he said, \u201cThis is the camp of God!\u201d So he named that place Mahanaim. Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. He instructed them: \u201cThis is what you are to say to my lord Esau: \u2018Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.\u2019\u201d When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, \u201cWe went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.\u201d In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well. He thought, \u201cIf Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.\u201d Then Jacob prayed, \u201cO God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, \u2018Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,\u2019 I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. But you have said, \u2018I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.\u2019\u201d He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, \u201cGo ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.\u201d He instructed the one in the lead: \u201cWhen my brother Esau meets you and asks, \u2018Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?\u2019 then you are to say, \u2018They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.\u2019\u201d He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: \u201cYou are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. And be sure to say, \u2018Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.\u2019\u201d For he thought, \u201cI will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.\u201d So Jacob\u2019s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob\u2019s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. Then the man said, \u201cLet me go, for it is daybreak.\u201d\nBut Jacob replied, \u201cI will not let you go unless you bless me.\u201d The man asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cJacob,\u201d he answered. Then the man said, \u201cYour name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.\u201d Jacob said, \u201cPlease tell me your name.\u201d\nBut he replied, \u201cWhy do you ask my name?\u201d Then he blessed him there. So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, \u201cIt is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.\u201d The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob\u2019s hip was touched near the tendon. \n\nJacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. \u201cWho are these with you?\u201d he asked.\nJacob answered, \u201cThey are the children God has graciously given your servant.\u201d Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. Esau asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?\u201d\n\u201cTo find favor in your eyes, my lord,\u201d he said. But Esau said, \u201cI already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, please!\u201d said Jacob. \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.\u201d And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. Then Esau said, \u201cLet us be on our way; I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d But Jacob said to him, \u201cMy lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.\u201d Esau said, \u201cThen let me leave some of my men with you.\u201d\n\u201cBut why do that?\u201d Jacob asked. \u201cJust let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.\u201d So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth. After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. \n\nNow Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her. His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. And Shechem said to his father Hamor, \u201cGet me this girl as my wife.\u201d When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home. Then Shechem\u2019s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob. Meanwhile, Jacob\u2019s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in Israel by sleeping with Jacob\u2019s daughter\u2014a thing that should not be done. But Hamor said to them, \u201cMy son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it.\u201d Then Shechem said to Dinah\u2019s father and brothers, \u201cLet me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask. Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I\u2019ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.\u201d Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob\u2019s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor. They said to them, \u201cWe can\u2019t do such a thing; we can\u2019t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males. Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We\u2019ll settle among you and become one people with you. But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we\u2019ll take our sister and go.\u201d Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. The young man, who was the most honored of all his father\u2019s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob\u2019s daughter. So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city. \u201cThese men are friendly toward us,\u201d they said. \u201cLet them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. Won\u2019t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.\u201d All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob\u2019s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\u2019s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem\u2019s house and left. The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled. They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, \u201cYou have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.\u201d But they replied, \u201cShould he have treated our sister like a prostitute?\u201d \n\nThen God said to Jacob, \u201cGo up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.\u201d So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, \u201cGet rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.\u201d So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. Now Deborah, Rebekah\u2019s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth. After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. God said to him, \u201cYour name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.\u201d So he named him Israel. And God said to him, \u201cI am God Almighty; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants. The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.\u201d Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t despair, for you have another son.\u201d As she breathed her last\u2014for she was dying\u2014she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin. So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel\u2019s tomb. Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father\u2019s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.\nJacob had twelve sons: The sons of Leah:\nReuben the firstborn of Jacob,\nSimeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. The sons of Rachel:\nJoseph and Benjamin. The sons of Rachel\u2019s servant Bilhah:\nDan and Naphtali. The sons of Leah\u2019s servant Zilpah:\nGad and Asher.\nThese were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. \n\nThis is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom). Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite\u2014 also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan. Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob. Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock. So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir. This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. These are the names of Esau\u2019s sons:\nEliphaz, the son of Esau\u2019s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau\u2019s wife Basemath. The sons of Eliphaz:\nTeman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz. Esau\u2019s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau\u2019s wife Adah. The sons of Reuel:\nNahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau\u2019s wife Basemath. The sons of Esau\u2019s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau:\nJeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs among Esau\u2019s descendants:\nThe sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau:\nChiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, Korah, Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah. The sons of Esau\u2019s son Reuel:\nChiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau\u2019s wife Basemath. The sons of Esau\u2019s wife Oholibamah:\nChiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau\u2019s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah. These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs. These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region:\nLotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs. The sons of Lotan:\nHori and Homam. Timna was Lotan\u2019s sister. The sons of Shobal:\nAlvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam. The sons of Zibeon:\nAiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. The children of Anah:\nDishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah. The sons of Dishon:\nHemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran. The sons of Ezer:\nBilhan, Zaavan and Akan. The sons of Dishan:\nUz and Aran. These were the Horite chiefs:\nLotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir. These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned: Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah. When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king. When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king. When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith. When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king. When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king. When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king. When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife\u2019s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab. These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions:\nTimna, Alvah, Jetheth, Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied.\nThis is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites. \n\nJacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. This is the account of Jacob\u2019s family line.\nJoseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father\u2019s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate robe for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. He said to them, \u201cListen to this dream I had: We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.\u201d His brothers said to him, \u201cDo you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?\u201d And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\u201d When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, \u201cWhat is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?\u201d His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. Now his brothers had gone to graze their father\u2019s flocks near Shechem, and Israel said to Joseph, \u201cAs you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he replied. So he said to him, \u201cGo and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.\u201d Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.\nWhen Joseph arrived at Shechem, a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d He replied, \u201cI\u2019m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?\u201d \u201cThey have moved on from here,\u201d the man answered. \u201cI heard them say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Dothan.\u2019\u201d\nSo Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. \u201cHere comes that dreamer!\u201d they said to each other. \u201cCome now, let\u2019s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we\u2019ll see what comes of his dreams.\u201d When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. \u201cLet\u2019s not take his life,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don\u2019t lay a hand on him.\u201d Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe\u2014the ornate robe he was wearing\u2014 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it. As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. Judah said to his brothers, \u201cWhat will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come, let\u2019s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\u201d His brothers agreed. So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. He went back to his brothers and said, \u201cThe boy isn\u2019t there! Where can I turn now?\u201d Then they got Joseph\u2019s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, \u201cWe found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son\u2019s robe.\u201d He recognized it and said, \u201cIt is my son\u2019s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.\u201d Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.\u201d So his father wept for him. Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh\u2019s officials, the captain of the guard. \n\nAt that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her; she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But Er, Judah\u2019s firstborn, was wicked in the Lord\u2019s sight; so the Lord put him to death. Then Judah said to Onan, \u201cSleep with your brother\u2019s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.\u201d But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother\u2019s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. What he did was wicked in the Lord\u2019s sight; so the Lord put him to death also. Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, \u201cLive as a widow in your father\u2019s household until my son Shelah grows up.\u201d For he thought, \u201cHe may die too, just like his brothers.\u201d So Tamar went to live in her father\u2019s household. After a long time Judah\u2019s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. When Tamar was told, \u201cYour father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,\u201d she took off her widow\u2019s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, \u201cCome now, let me sleep with you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what will you give me to sleep with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll send you a young goat from my flock,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWill you give me something as a pledge until you send it?\u201d she asked. He said, \u201cWhat pledge should I give you?\u201d\n\u201cYour seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,\u201d she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow\u2019s clothes again. Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her. He asked the men who lived there, \u201cWhere is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?\u201d\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any shrine prostitute here,\u201d they said. So he went back to Judah and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, \u2018There hasn\u2019t been any shrine prostitute here.\u2019\u201d Then Judah said, \u201cLet her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn\u2019t find her.\u201d About three months later Judah was told, \u201cYour daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.\u201d\nJudah said, \u201cBring her out and have her burned to death!\u201d As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. \u201cI am pregnant by the man who owns these,\u201d she said. And she added, \u201cSee if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.\u201d Judah recognized them and said, \u201cShe is more righteous than I, since I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d And he did not sleep with her again. When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, \u201cSo this is how you have broken out!\u201d And he was named Perez. Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah. \n\nNow Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh\u2019s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master. When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did, Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field. So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph\u2019s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.\nNow Joseph was well-built and handsome, and after a while his master\u2019s wife took notice of Joseph and said, \u201cCome to bed with me!\u201d But he refused. \u201cWith me in charge,\u201d he told her, \u201cmy master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care. No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?\u201d And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. She caught him by his cloak and said, \u201cCome to bed with me!\u201d But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, she called her household servants. \u201cLook,\u201d she said to them, \u201cthis Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.\u201d She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. Then she told him this story: \u201cThat Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me. But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.\u201d When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, \u201cThis is how your slave treated me,\u201d he burned with anger. Joseph\u2019s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king\u2019s prisoners were confined.\nBut while Joseph was there in the prison, the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph\u2019s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did. \n\nSome time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.\nAfter they had been in custody for some time, each of the two men\u2014the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison\u2014had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. So he asked Pharaoh\u2019s officials who were in custody with him in his master\u2019s house, \u201cWhy do you look so sad today?\u201d \u201cWe both had dreams,\u201d they answered, \u201cbut there is no one to interpret them.\u201d\nThen Joseph said to them, \u201cDo not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.\u201d So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, \u201cIn my dream I saw a vine in front of me, and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. Pharaoh\u2019s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh\u2019s cup and put the cup in his hand.\u201d \u201cThis is what it means,\u201d Joseph said to him. \u201cThe three branches are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh\u2019s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.\u201d When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, \u201cI too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread. In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.\u201d \u201cThis is what it means,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cThe three baskets are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.\u201d Now the third day was Pharaoh\u2019s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh\u2019s hand\u2014 but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him. \n\nWhen two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile, when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds. After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank. And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted\u2014thin and scorched by the east wind. The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \u201cToday I am reminded of my shortcomings. Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.\u201d So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\u201d \u201cI cannot do it,\u201d Joseph replied to Pharaoh, \u201cbut God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.\u201d Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cIn my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. After them, seven other cows came up\u2014scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. \u201cIn my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. After them, seven other heads sprouted\u2014withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.\u201d Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. \u201cIt is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. \u201cAnd now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.\u201d The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. So Pharaoh asked them, \u201cCan we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?\u201d Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cSince God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.\u201d So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.\u201d Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph\u2019s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, \u201cMake way!\u201d Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.\u201d Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh\u2019s presence and traveled throughout Egypt. During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, \u201cIt is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father\u2019s household.\u201d The second son he named Ephraim and said, \u201cIt is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.\u201d The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, \u201cGo to Joseph and do what he tells you.\u201d When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere. \n\nWhen Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, \u201cWhy do you just keep looking at each other?\u201d He continued, \u201cI have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.\u201d Then ten of Joseph\u2019s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph\u2019s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him. So Israel\u2019s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also. Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph\u2019s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cFrom the land of Canaan,\u201d they replied, \u201cto buy food.\u201d Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, \u201cYou are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.\u201d \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d they answered. \u201cYour servants have come to buy food. We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d he said to them. \u201cYou have come to see where our land is unprotected.\u201d But they replied, \u201cYour servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.\u201d Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is just as I told you: You are spies! And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!\u201d And he put them all in custody for three days. On the third day, Joseph said to them, \u201cDo this and you will live, for I fear God: If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households. But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.\u201d This they proceeded to do. They said to one another, \u201cSurely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that\u2019s why this distress has come on us.\u201d Reuben replied, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn\u2019t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.\u201d They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter. He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man\u2019s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them, they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left. At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. \u201cMy silver has been returned,\u201d he said to his brothers. \u201cHere it is in my sack.\u201d\nTheir hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, \u201cWhat is this that God has done to us?\u201d When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, \u201cThe man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land. But we said to him, \u2018We are honest men; we are not spies. We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.\u2019 \u201cThen the man who is lord over the land said to us, \u2018This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go. But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.\u2019\u201d As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man\u2019s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened. Their father Jacob said to them, \u201cYou have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!\u201d Then Reuben said to his father, \u201cYou may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.\u201d But Jacob said, \u201cMy son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.\u201d \n\nNow the famine was still severe in the land. So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, \u201cGo back and buy us a little more food.\u201d But Judah said to him, \u201cThe man warned us solemnly, \u2018You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.\u2019 If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you. But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, \u2018You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.\u2019\u201d Israel asked, \u201cWhy did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?\u201d They replied, \u201cThe man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. \u2018Is your father still living?\u2019 he asked us. \u2018Do you have another brother?\u2019 We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, \u2018Bring your brother down here\u2019?\u201d Then Judah said to Israel his father, \u201cSend the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die. I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life. As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.\u201d Then their father Israel said to them, \u201cIf it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift\u2014a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds. Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. Take your brother also and go back to the man at once. And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.\u201d So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph. When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, \u201cTake these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.\u201d The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph\u2019s house. Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, \u201cWe were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.\u201d So they went up to Joseph\u2019s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. \u201cWe beg your pardon, our lord,\u201d they said, \u201cwe came down here the first time to buy food. But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver\u2014the exact weight\u2014in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us. We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don\u2019t know who put our silver in our sacks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.\u201d Then he brought Simeon out to them. The steward took the men into Joseph\u2019s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys. They prepared their gifts for Joseph\u2019s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there. When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground. He asked them how they were, and then he said, \u201cHow is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?\u201d They replied, \u201cYour servant our father is still alive and well.\u201d And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him. As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother\u2019s son, he asked, \u201cIs this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?\u201d And he said, \u201cGod be gracious to you, my son.\u201d Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there. After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, \u201cServe the food.\u201d They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians. The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment. When portions were served to them from Joseph\u2019s table, Benjamin\u2019s portion was five times as much as anyone else\u2019s. So they feasted and drank freely with him. \n\nNow Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: \u201cFill the men\u2019s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man\u2019s silver in the mouth of his sack. Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one\u2019s sack, along with the silver for his grain.\u201d And he did as Joseph said. As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, \u201cGo after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, \u2018Why have you repaid good with evil? Isn\u2019t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.\u2019\u201d When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them. But they said to him, \u201cWhy does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that! We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master\u2019s house? If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord\u2019s slaves.\u201d \u201cVery well, then,\u201d he said, \u201clet it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.\u201d Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin\u2019s sack. At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city. Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him. Joseph said to them, \u201cWhat is this you have done? Don\u2019t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?\u201d \u201cWhat can we say to my lord?\u201d Judah replied. \u201cWhat can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants\u2019 guilt. We are now my lord\u2019s slaves\u2014we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.\u201d But Joseph said, \u201cFar be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.\u201d Then Judah went up to him and said: \u201cPardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself. My lord asked his servants, \u2018Do you have a father or a brother?\u2019 And we answered, \u2018We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother\u2019s sons left, and his father loves him.\u2019 \u201cThen you said to your servants, \u2018Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.\u2019 And we said to my lord, \u2018The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.\u2019 But you told your servants, \u2018Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.\u2019 When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. \u201cThen our father said, \u2018Go back and buy a little more food.\u2019 But we said, \u2018We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man\u2019s face unless our youngest brother is with us.\u2019 \u201cYour servant my father said to us, \u2018You know that my wife bore me two sons. One of them went away from me, and I said, \u201cHe has surely been torn to pieces.\u201d And I have not seen him since. If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.\u2019 \u201cSo now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy\u2019s life, sees that the boy isn\u2019t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow. Your servant guaranteed the boy\u2019s safety to my father. I said, \u2018If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!\u2019 \u201cNow then, please let your servant remain here as my lord\u2019s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.\u201d \n\nThen Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, \u201cHave everyone leave my presence!\u201d So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh\u2019s household heard about it. Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cI am Joseph! Is my father still living?\u201d But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. Then Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cCome close to me.\u201d When they had done so, he said, \u201cI am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping. But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. \u201cSo then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. Now hurry back to my father and say to him, \u2018This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don\u2019t delay. You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me\u2014you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.\u2019 \u201cYou can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you. Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.\u201d Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping. And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. When the news reached Pharaoh\u2019s palace that Joseph\u2019s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cTell your brothers, \u2018Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan, and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.\u2019 \u201cYou are also directed to tell them, \u2018Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come. Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.\u2019\u201d So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes. And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, \u201cDon\u2019t quarrel on the way!\u201d So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. They told him, \u201cJoseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.\u201d Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. And Israel said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.\u201d \n\nSo Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, \u201cJacob! Jacob!\u201d\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he replied. \u201cI am God, the God of your father,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph\u2019s own hand will close your eyes.\u201d Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel\u2019s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him. So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan. Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters\u2014all his offspring. These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt:\nReuben the firstborn of Jacob. The sons of Reuben:\nHanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. The sons of Simeon:\nJemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. The sons of Levi:\nGershon, Kohath and Merari. The sons of Judah:\nEr, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan).\nThe sons of Perez:\nHezron and Hamul. The sons of Issachar:\nTola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron. The sons of Zebulun:\nSered, Elon and Jahleel. These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all. The sons of Gad:\nZephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. The sons of Asher:\nImnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah.\nTheir sister was Serah.\nThe sons of Beriah:\nHeber and Malkiel. These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah\u2014sixteen in all. The sons of Jacob\u2019s wife Rachel:\nJoseph and Benjamin. In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. The sons of Benjamin:\nBela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob\u2014fourteen in all. The son of Dan:\nHushim. The sons of Naphtali:\nJahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem. These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel\u2014seven in all. All those who went to Egypt with Jacob\u2014those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons\u2019 wives\u2014numbered sixty-six persons. With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob\u2019s family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all. Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen, Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time. Israel said to Joseph, \u201cNow I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.\u201d Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father\u2019s household, \u201cI will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, \u2018My brothers and my father\u2019s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me. The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.\u2019 When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, \u2018What is your occupation?\u2019 you should answer, \u2018Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.\u2019 Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.\u201d \n\nJoseph went and told Pharaoh, \u201cMy father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.\u201d He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked the brothers, \u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d\n\u201cYour servants are shepherds,\u201d they replied to Pharaoh, \u201cjust as our fathers were.\u201d They also said to him, \u201cWe have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants\u2019 flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.\u201d Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cYour father and your brothers have come to you, and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.\u201d Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh, Pharaoh asked him, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d And Jacob said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.\u201d Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence. So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed. Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father\u2019s household with food, according to the number of their children. There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine. Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh\u2019s palace. When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, \u201cGive us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.\u201d \u201cThen bring your livestock,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cI will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.\u201d So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock. When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, \u201cWe cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. Why should we perish before your eyes\u2014we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.\u201d So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh\u2019s, and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other. However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land. Joseph said to the people, \u201cNow that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground. But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.\u201d \u201cYou have saved our lives,\u201d they said. \u201cMay we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.\u201d So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt\u2014still in force today\u2014that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh\u2019s. Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number. Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven. When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.\u201d\n\u201cI will do as you say,\u201d he said. \u201cSwear to me,\u201d he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. \n\nSome time later Joseph was told, \u201cYour father is ill.\u201d So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. When Jacob was told, \u201cYour son Joseph has come to you,\u201d Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. Jacob said to Joseph, \u201cGod Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me and said to me, \u2018I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.\u2019 \u201cNow then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath\u201d (that is, Bethlehem). When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, \u201cWho are these?\u201d \u201cThey are the sons God has given me here,\u201d Joseph said to his father.\nThen Israel said, \u201cBring them to me so I may bless them.\u201d Now Israel\u2019s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. Israel said to Joseph, \u201cI never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.\u201d Then Joseph removed them from Israel\u2019s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel\u2019s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel\u2019s right hand, and brought them close to him. But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim\u2019s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh\u2019s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. Then he blessed Joseph and said,\n\u201cMay the God before whom my fathers\n    Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully,\nthe God who has been my shepherd\n    all my life to this day, the Angel who has delivered me from all harm\n    \u2014may he bless these boys.\nMay they be called by my name\n    and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,\nand may they increase greatly\n    on the earth.\u201d When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim\u2019s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father\u2019s hand to move it from Ephraim\u2019s head to Manasseh\u2019s head. Joseph said to him, \u201cNo, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.\u201d But his father refused and said, \u201cI know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.\u201d He blessed them that day and said,\n\u201cIn your name will Israel pronounce this blessing:\n    \u2018May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.\u2019\u201d\nSo he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. Then Israel said to Joseph, \u201cI am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers. And to you I give one more ridge of land than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.\u201d \n\nThen Jacob called for his sons and said: \u201cGather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come. \u201cAssemble and listen, sons of Jacob;\n    listen to your father Israel. \u201cReuben, you are my firstborn,\n    my might, the first sign of my strength,\n    excelling in honor, excelling in power. Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel,\n    for you went up onto your father\u2019s bed,\n    onto my couch and defiled it. \u201cSimeon and Levi are brothers\u2014\n    their swords are weapons of violence. Let me not enter their council,\n    let me not join their assembly,\nfor they have killed men in their anger\n    and hamstrung oxen as they pleased. Cursed be their anger, so fierce,\n    and their fury, so cruel!\nI will scatter them in Jacob\n    and disperse them in Israel. \u201cJudah, your brothers will praise you;\n    your hand will be on the neck of your enemies;\n    your father\u2019s sons will bow down to you. You are a lion\u2019s cub, Judah;\n    you return from the prey, my son.\nLike a lion he crouches and lies down,\n    like a lioness\u2014who dares to rouse him? The scepter will not depart from Judah,\n    nor the ruler\u2019s staff from between his feet,\nuntil he to whom it belongs shall come\n    and the obedience of the nations shall be his. He will tether his donkey to a vine,\n    his colt to the choicest branch;\nhe will wash his garments in wine,\n    his robes in the blood of grapes. His eyes will be darker than wine,\n    his teeth whiter than milk. \u201cZebulun will live by the seashore\n    and become a haven for ships;\n    his border will extend toward Sidon. \u201cIssachar is a rawboned donkey\n    lying down among the sheep pens. When he sees how good is his resting place\n    and how pleasant is his land,\nhe will bend his shoulder to the burden\n    and submit to forced labor. \u201cDan will provide justice for his people\n    as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan will be a snake by the roadside,\n    a viper along the path,\nthat bites the horse\u2019s heels\n    so that its rider tumbles backward. \u201cI look for your deliverance, Lord. \u201cGad will be attacked by a band of raiders,\n    but he will attack them at their heels. \u201cAsher\u2019s food will be rich;\n    he will provide delicacies fit for a king. \u201cNaphtali is a doe set free\n    that bears beautiful fawns. \u201cJoseph is a fruitful vine,\n    a fruitful vine near a spring,\n    whose branches climb over a wall. With bitterness archers attacked him;\n    they shot at him with hostility. But his bow remained steady,\n    his strong arms stayed limber,\nbecause of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,\n    because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, because of your father\u2019s God, who helps you,\n    because of the Almighty, who blesses you\nwith blessings of the skies above,\n    blessings of the deep springs below,\n    blessings of the breast and womb. Your father\u2019s blessings are greater\n    than the blessings of the ancient mountains,\n    than the bounty of the age-old hills.\nLet all these rest on the head of Joseph,\n    on the brow of the prince among his brothers. \u201cBenjamin is a ravenous wolf;\n    in the morning he devours the prey,\n    in the evening he divides the plunder.\u201d All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him. Then he gave them these instructions: \u201cI am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah. The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.\u201d When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people. \n\nJoseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh\u2019s court, \u201cIf I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, \u2018My father made me swear an oath and said, \u201cI am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.\u201d Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.\u2019\u201d Pharaoh said, \u201cGo up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.\u201d So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh\u2019s officials accompanied him\u2014the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt\u2014 besides all the members of Joseph\u2019s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father\u2019s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company. When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, \u201cThe Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.\u201d That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim. So Jacob\u2019s sons did as he had commanded them: They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. When Joseph\u2019s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, \u201cWhat if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?\u201d So they sent word to Joseph, saying, \u201cYour father left these instructions before he died: \u2018This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.\u2019 Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.\u201d When their message came to him, Joseph wept. His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. \u201cWe are your slaves,\u201d they said. But Joseph said to them, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. So then, don\u2019t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.\u201d And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father\u2019s family. He lived a hundred and ten years and saw the third generation of Ephraim\u2019s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph\u2019s knees. Then Joseph said to his brothers, \u201cI am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\u201d And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, \u201cGod will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.\u201d So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt. \n\n",
