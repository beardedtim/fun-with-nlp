    "text": "This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham was the father of Isaac,\nIsaac the father of Jacob,\nJacob the father of Judah and his brothers, Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar,\nPerez the father of Hezron,\nHezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,\nAmminadab the father of Nahshon,\nNahshon the father of Salmon, Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab,\nBoaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth,\nObed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of King David.\nDavid was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah\u2019s wife, Solomon the father of Rehoboam,\nRehoboam the father of Abijah,\nAbijah the father of Asa, Asa the father of Jehoshaphat,\nJehoshaphat the father of Jehoram,\nJehoram the father of Uzziah, Uzziah the father of Jotham,\nJotham the father of Ahaz,\nAhaz the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,\nManasseh the father of Amon,\nAmon the father of Josiah, and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. After the exile to Babylon:\nJeconiah was the father of Shealtiel,\nShealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel the father of Abihud,\nAbihud the father of Eliakim,\nEliakim the father of Azor, Azor the father of Zadok,\nZadok the father of Akim,\nAkim the father of Elihud, Elihud the father of Eleazar,\nEleazar the father of Matthan,\nMatthan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah. Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah. This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\u201d All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \u201cThe virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\u201d (which means \u201cGod with us\u201d). When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. \n\nAfter Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, \u201cWhere is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\u201d When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. When he had called together all the people\u2019s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. \u201cIn Bethlehem in Judea,\u201d they replied, \u201cfor this is what the prophet has written: \u201c\u2018But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,\n    are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;\nfor out of you will come a ruler\n    who will shepherd my people Israel.\u2019\u201d Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \u201cGo and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.\u201d After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. \u201cGet up,\u201d he said, \u201ctake the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.\u201d So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: \u201cOut of Egypt I called my son.\u201d When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: \u201cA voice is heard in Ramah,\n    weeping and great mourning,\nRachel weeping for her children\n    and refusing to be comforted,\n    because they are no more.\u201d After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child\u2019s life are dead.\u201d So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene. \n\nIn those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, \u201cRepent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.\u201d This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:\n\u201cA voice of one calling in the wilderness,\n\u2018Prepare the way for the Lord,\n    make straight paths for him.\u2019\u201d John\u2019s clothes were made of camel\u2019s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: \u201cYou brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not think you can say to yourselves, \u2018We have Abraham as our father.\u2019 I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. \u201cI baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\u201d Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, \u201cI need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cLet it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Then John consented. As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\u201d \n\nThen Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, \u201cIf you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. \u201cIf you are the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201cthrow yourself down. For it is written:\n\u201c\u2018He will command his angels concerning you,\n    and they will lift you up in their hands,\n    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\u2019\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cIt is also written: \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u201d Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. \u201cAll this I will give you,\u201d he said, \u201cif you will bow down and worship me.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cAway from me, Satan! For it is written: \u2018Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.\u2019\u201d Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali\u2014 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: \u201cLand of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,\n    the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,\n    Galilee of the Gentiles\u2014 the people living in darkness\n    have seen a great light;\non those living in the land of the shadow of death\n    a light has dawned.\u201d From that time on Jesus began to preach, \u201cRepent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.\u201d As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. \u201cCome, follow me,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cand I will send you out to fish for people.\u201d At once they left their nets and followed him. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them. Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him. \n\nNow when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.\nHe said: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit,\n    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn,\n    for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek,\n    for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\n    for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful,\n    for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart,\n    for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers,\n    for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,\n    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \u201cBlessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. \u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. \u201cYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. \u201cYou have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \u2018You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, \u2018Raca,\u2019 is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be in danger of the fire of hell. \u201cTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift. \u201cSettle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. \u201cIt has been said, \u2018Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. \u201cAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \u2018Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.\u2019 But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God\u2019s throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.\u2019 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. \n\n\u201cBe careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. \u201cSo when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. \u201cAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. \u201cThis, then, is how you should pray:\n\u201c\u2018Our Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name, your kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\n    on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts,\n    as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation,\n    but deliver us from the evil one.\u2019 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. \u201cWhen you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. \u201cDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! \u201cNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. \u201cTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? \u201cAnd why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we wear?\u2019 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. \n\n\u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. \u201cWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye,\u2019 when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye. \u201cDo not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. \u201cAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. \u201cWhich of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. \u201cEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it. \u201cWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them. \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?\u2019 Then I will tell them plainly, \u2018I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\u2019 \u201cTherefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\u201d When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law. \n\nWhen Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, \u201cLord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\u201d Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \u201cI am willing,\u201d he said. \u201cBe clean!\u201d Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Then Jesus said to him, \u201cSee that you don\u2019t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.\u201d When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. \u201cLord,\u201d he said, \u201cmy servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cShall I come and heal him?\u201d The centurion replied, \u201cLord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, \u2018Go,\u2019 and he goes; and that one, \u2018Come,\u2019 and he comes. I say to my servant, \u2018Do this,\u2019 and he does it.\u201d When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, \u201cTruly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d Then Jesus said to the centurion, \u201cGo! Let it be done just as you believed it would.\u201d And his servant was healed at that moment. When Jesus came into Peter\u2019s house, he saw Peter\u2019s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n\u201cHe took up our infirmities\n    and bore our diseases.\u201d When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, \u201cTeacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cFoxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\u201d Another disciple said to him, \u201cLord, first let me go and bury my father.\u201d But Jesus told him, \u201cFollow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.\u201d Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, \u201cLord, save us! We\u2019re going to drown!\u201d He replied, \u201cYou of little faith, why are you so afraid?\u201d Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The men were amazed and asked, \u201cWhat kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!\u201d When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. \u201cWhat do you want with us, Son of God?\u201d they shouted. \u201cHave you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\u201d Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. The demons begged Jesus, \u201cIf you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\u201d He said to them, \u201cGo!\u201d So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region. \n\nJesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, \u201cTake heart, son; your sins are forgiven.\u201d At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, \u201cThis fellow is blaspheming!\u201d Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, \u201cWhy do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, \u2018Your sins are forgiven,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Get up and walk\u2019? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d So he said to the paralyzed man, \u201cGet up, take your mat and go home.\u201d Then the man got up and went home. When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man. As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector\u2019s booth. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew\u2019s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, \u201cWhy does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\u201d On hearing this, Jesus said, \u201cIt is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: \u2018I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\u2019 For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\u201d Then John\u2019s disciples came and asked him, \u201cHow is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cHow can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. \u201cNo one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\u201d While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, \u201cMy daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.\u201d Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, \u201cIf I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.\u201d Jesus turned and saw her. \u201cTake heart, daughter,\u201d he said, \u201cyour faith has healed you.\u201d And the woman was healed at that moment. When Jesus entered the synagogue leader\u2019s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, he said, \u201cGo away. The girl is not dead but asleep.\u201d But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. News of this spread through all that region. As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, \u201cHave mercy on us, Son of David!\u201d When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, \u201cDo you believe that I am able to do this?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Lord,\u201d they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, \u201cAccording to your faith let it be done to you\u201d; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, \u201cSee that no one knows about this.\u201d But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region. While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, \u201cNothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.\u201d But the Pharisees said, \u201cIt is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.\u201d Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, \u201cThe harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\u201d \n\nJesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \u201cDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: \u2018The kingdom of heaven has come near.\u2019 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u201cDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u2014 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. \u201cI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. \u201cBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \u201cThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! \u201cSo do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn\n\u201c\u2018a man against his father,\n    a daughter against her mother,\na daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014 a man\u2019s enemies will be the members of his own household.\u2019 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. \u201cAnyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet\u2019s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person\u2019s reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.\u201d \n\nAfter Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, \u201cAre you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cGo back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.\u201d As John\u2019s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \u201cWhat did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings\u2019 palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:\n\u201c\u2018I will send my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way before you.\u2019 Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear. \u201cTo what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: \u201c\u2018We played the pipe for you,\n    and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge,\n    and you did not mourn.\u2019 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, \u2018He has a demon.\u2019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, \u2018Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.\u2019 But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\u201d Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. \u201cWoe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.\u201d At that time Jesus said, \u201cI praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. \u201cAll things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u201d \n\nAt that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \u201cLook! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.\u201d He answered, \u201cHaven\u2019t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread\u2014which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven\u2019t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, \u2018I desire mercy, not sacrifice,\u2019 you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\u201d Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\u201d He said to them, \u201cIf any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\u201d Then he said to the man, \u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others about him. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \u201cHere is my servant whom I have chosen,\n    the one I love, in whom I delight;\nI will put my Spirit on him,\n    and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out;\n    no one will hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break,\n    and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,\ntill he has brought justice through to victory. In his name the nations will put their hope.\u201d Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, \u201cCould this be the Son of David?\u201d But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, \u201cIt is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.\u201d Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. \u201cOr again, how can anyone enter a strong man\u2019s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. \u201cMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\u201d Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \u201cTeacher, we want to see a sign from you.\u201d He answered, \u201cA wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon\u2019s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here. \u201cWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, \u2018I will return to the house I left.\u2019 When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\u201d While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, \u201cYour mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.\u201d He replied to him, \u201cWho is my mother, and who are my brothers?\u201d Pointing to his disciples, he said, \u201cHere are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\u201d \n\nThat same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop\u2014a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\u201d The disciples came to him and asked, \u201cWhy do you speak to the people in parables?\u201d He replied, \u201cBecause the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables:\n\u201cThough seeing, they do not see;\n    though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:\n\u201c\u2018You will be ever hearing but never understanding;\n    you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people\u2019s heart has become calloused;\n    they hardly hear with their ears,\n    and they have closed their eyes.\nOtherwise they might see with their eyes,\n    hear with their ears,\n    understand with their hearts\nand turn, and I would heal them.\u2019 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. \u201cListen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\u201d Jesus told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. \u201cThe owner\u2019s servants came to him and said, \u2018Sir, didn\u2019t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?\u2019 \u201c\u2018An enemy did this,\u2019 he replied.\n\u201cThe servants asked him, \u2018Do you want us to go and pull them up?\u2019 \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 he answered, \u2018because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.\u2019\u201d He told them another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\u201d He told them still another parable: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\u201d Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:\n\u201cI will open my mouth in parables,\n    I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\u201d Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \u201cExplain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\u201d He answered, \u201cThe one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. \u201cAs the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. \u201cAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. \u201cOnce again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \u201cHave you understood all these things?\u201d Jesus asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d they replied. He said to them, \u201cTherefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\u201d When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \u201cWhere did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\u201d they asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the carpenter\u2019s son? Isn\u2019t his mother\u2019s name Mary, and aren\u2019t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? Aren\u2019t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\u201d And they took offense at him.\nBut Jesus said to them, \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.\u201d And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. \n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, and he said to his attendants, \u201cThis is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\u201d Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip\u2019s wife, for John had been saying to him: \u201cIt is not lawful for you to have her.\u201d Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet. On Herod\u2019s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted by her mother, she said, \u201cGive me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\u201d The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted and had John beheaded in the prison. His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. John\u2019s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, \u201cThis is a remote place, and it\u2019s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cThey do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.\u201d \u201cWe have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,\u201d they answered. \u201cBring them here to me,\u201d he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children. Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s a ghost,\u201d they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: \u201cTake courage! It is I. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d \u201cLord, if it\u2019s you,\u201d Peter replied, \u201ctell me to come to you on the water.\u201d \u201cCome,\u201d he said.\nThen Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \u201cLord, save me!\u201d Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \u201cYou of little faith,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy did you doubt?\u201d And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, \u201cTruly you are the Son of God.\u201d When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed. \n\nThen some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, \u201cWhy do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don\u2019t wash their hands before they eat!\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cAnd why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? For God said, \u2018Honor your father and mother\u2019 and \u2018Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.\u2019 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is \u2018devoted to God,\u2019 they are not to \u2018honor their father or mother\u2019 with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: \u201c\u2018These people honor me with their lips,\n    but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain;\n    their teachings are merely human rules.\u2019\u201d Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \u201cListen and understand. What goes into someone\u2019s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.\u201d Then the disciples came to him and asked, \u201cDo you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?\u201d He replied, \u201cEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.\u201d Peter said, \u201cExplain the parable to us.\u201d \u201cAre you still so dull?\u201d Jesus asked them. \u201cDon\u2019t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person\u2019s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts\u2014murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.\u201d Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \u201cLord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.\u201d Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \u201cSend her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\u201d He answered, \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\u201d The woman came and knelt before him. \u201cLord, help me!\u201d she said. He replied, \u201cIt is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to the dogs.\u201d \u201cYes it is, Lord,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master\u2019s table.\u201d Then Jesus said to her, \u201cWoman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\u201d And her daughter was healed at that moment. Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \u201cI have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.\u201d His disciples answered, \u201cWhere could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\u201d \u201cHow many loaves do you have?\u201d Jesus asked.\n\u201cSeven,\u201d they replied, \u201cand a few small fish.\u201d He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan. \n\nThe Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. He replied, \u201cWhen evening comes, you say, \u2018It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,\u2019 and in the morning, \u2018Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Jesus then left them and went away. When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. \u201cBe careful,\u201d Jesus said to them. \u201cBe on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d They discussed this among themselves and said, \u201cIt is because we didn\u2019t bring any bread.\u201d Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, \u201cYou of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don\u2019t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How is it you don\u2019t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\u201d Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d They replied, \u201cSome say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\u201d \u201cBut what about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho do you say I am?\u201d Simon Peter answered, \u201cYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u201d Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \u201cNever, Lord!\u201d he said. \u201cThis shall never happen to you!\u201d Jesus turned and said to Peter, \u201cGet behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\u201d Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cWhoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father\u2019s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. \u201cTruly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201d \n\nAfter six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, \u201cLord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters\u2014one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\u201d While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!\u201d When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. \u201cGet up,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\u201d The disciples asked him, \u201cWhy then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cTo be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u201d Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. \u201cLord, have mercy on my son,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.\u201d \u201cYou unbelieving and perverse generation,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201chow long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\u201d Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment. Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we drive it out?\u201d He replied, \u201cBecause you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u2018Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d  When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, \u201cThe Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.\u201d And the disciples were filled with grief. After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t your teacher pay the temple tax?\u201d \u201cYes, he does,\u201d he replied.\nWhen Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. \u201cWhat do you think, Simon?\u201d he asked. \u201cFrom whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes\u2014from their own children or from others?\u201d \u201cFrom others,\u201d Peter answered.\n\u201cThen the children are exempt,\u201d Jesus said to him. \u201cBut so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.\u201d \n\nAt that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \u201cWho, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\u201d He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. And he said: \u201cTruly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. \u201cIf anyone causes one of these little ones\u2014those who believe in me\u2014to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. \u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.  \u201cWhat do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. \u201cIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that \u2018every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.\u2019 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. \u201cTruly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. \u201cAgain, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\u201d Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \u201cLord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cI tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. \u201cTherefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. \u201cAt this the servant fell on his knees before him. \u2018Be patient with me,\u2019 he begged, \u2018and I will pay back everything.\u2019 The servant\u2019s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. \u201cBut when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. \u2018Pay back what you owe me!\u2019 he demanded. \u201cHis fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, \u2018Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.\u2019 \u201cBut he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. \u201cThen the master called the servant in. \u2018You wicked servant,\u2019 he said, \u2018I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn\u2019t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?\u2019 In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. \u201cThis is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\u201d \n\nWhen Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, \u201cIs it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t you read,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat at the beginning the Creator \u2018made them male and female,\u2019 and said, \u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh\u2019? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d \u201cWhy then,\u201d they asked, \u201cdid Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cMoses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d The disciples said to him, \u201cIf this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cNot everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others\u2014and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.\u201d Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said, \u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.\u201d When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there. Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, \u201cTeacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\u201d \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good?\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cThere is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\u201d \u201cWhich ones?\u201d he inquired.\nJesus replied, \u201c\u2018You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother,\u2019 and \u2018love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d \u201cAll these I have kept,\u201d the young man said. \u201cWhat do I still lack?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIf you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\u201d When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cTruly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d Jesus looked at them and said, \u201cWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\u201d Peter answered him, \u201cWe have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cTruly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first. \n\n\u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. \u201cAbout nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.\u2019 So they went.\n\u201cHe went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, \u2018Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Because no one has hired us,\u2019 they answered.\n\u201cHe said to them, \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard.\u2019 \u201cWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, \u2018Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.\u2019 \u201cThe workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. \u2018These who were hired last worked only one hour,\u2019 they said, \u2018and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\u2019 \u201cBut he answered one of them, \u2018I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn\u2019t you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u2019 \u201cSo the last will be first, and the first will be last.\u201d Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, \u201cWe are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!\u201d Then the mother of Zebedee\u2019s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d he asked.\nShe said, \u201cGrant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are asking,\u201d Jesus said to them. \u201cCan you drink the cup I am going to drink?\u201d\n\u201cWe can,\u201d they answered. Jesus said to them, \u201cYou will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.\u201d When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. Jesus called them together and said, \u201cYou know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave\u2014 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, \u201cLord, Son of David, have mercy on us!\u201d The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, \u201cLord, Son of David, have mercy on us!\u201d Jesus stopped and called them. \u201cWhat do you want me to do for you?\u201d he asked. \u201cLord,\u201d they answered, \u201cwe want our sight.\u201d Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him. \n\nAs they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, \u201cGo to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.\u201d This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: \u201cSay to Daughter Zion,\n    \u2018See, your king comes to you,\ngentle and riding on a donkey,\n    and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\u2019\u201d The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,\n\u201cHosanna to the Son of David!\u201d\n\u201cBlessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d\n\u201cHosanna in the highest heaven!\u201d When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201d The crowds answered, \u201cThis is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.\u201d Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. \u201cIt is written,\u201d he said to them, \u201c\u2018My house will be called a house of prayer,\u2019 but you are making it \u2018a den of robbers.\u2019\u201d The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, \u201cHosanna to the Son of David,\u201d they were indignant. \u201cDo you hear what these children are saying?\u201d they asked him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Jesus, \u201chave you never read,\n\u201c\u2018From the lips of children and infants\n    you, Lord, have called forth your praise\u2019?\u201d And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, \u201cMay you never bear fruit again!\u201d Immediately the tree withered. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. \u201cHow did the fig tree wither so quickly?\u201d they asked. Jesus replied, \u201cTruly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, \u2018Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u2019 and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\u201d Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. \u201cBy what authority are you doing these things?\u201d they asked. \u201cAnd who gave you this authority?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cI will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John\u2019s baptism\u2014where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?\u201d\nThey discussed it among themselves and said, \u201cIf we say, \u2018From heaven,\u2019 he will ask, \u2018Then why didn\u2019t you believe him?\u2019 But if we say, \u2018Of human origin\u2019\u2014we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.\u201d So they answered Jesus, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThen he said, \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. \u201cWhat do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, \u2018Son, go and work today in the vineyard.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I will not,\u2019 he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. \u201cThen the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, \u2018I will, sir,\u2019 but he did not go. \u201cWhich of the two did what his father wanted?\u201d\n\u201cThe first,\u201d they answered.\nJesus said to them, \u201cTruly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. \u201cListen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. \u201cThe tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. \u2018They will respect my son,\u2019 he said. \u201cBut when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, \u2018This is the heir. Come, let\u2019s kill him and take his inheritance.\u2019 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. \u201cTherefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\u201d \u201cHe will bring those wretches to a wretched end,\u201d they replied, \u201cand he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.\u201d Jesus said to them, \u201cHave you never read in the Scriptures:\n\u201c\u2018The stone the builders rejected\n    has become the cornerstone;\nthe Lord has done this,\n    and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019? \u201cTherefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u201d When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus\u2019 parables, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. \n\nJesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. \u201cThen he sent some more servants and said, \u2018Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.\u2019 \u201cBut they paid no attention and went off\u2014one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \u201cThen he said to his servants, \u2018The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.\u2019 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. \u201cBut when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, \u2018How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?\u2019 The man was speechless. \u201cThen the king told the attendants, \u2018Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019 \u201cFor many are invited, but few are chosen.\u201d Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. \u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cwe know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren\u2019t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?\u201d But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, \u201cYou hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? Show me the coin used for paying the tax.\u201d They brought him a denarius, and he asked them, \u201cWhose image is this? And whose inscription?\u201d \u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d they replied.\nThen he said to them, \u201cSo give back to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s, and to God what is God\u2019s.\u201d When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. \u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cMoses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cYou are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead\u2014have you not read what God said to you, \u2018I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob\u2019? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\u201d When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: \u201cTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\u201d Jesus replied: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, \u201cWhat do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?\u201d\n\u201cThe son of David,\u201d they replied. He said to them, \u201cHow is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him \u2018Lord\u2019? For he says, \u201c\u2018The Lord said to my Lord:\n    \u201cSit at my right hand\nuntil I put your enemies\n    under your feet.\u201d\u2019 If then David calls him \u2018Lord,\u2019 how can he be his son?\u201d No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions. \n\nThen Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: \u201cThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people\u2019s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. \u201cEverything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called \u2018Rabbi\u2019 by others. \u201cBut you are not to be called \u2018Rabbi,\u2019 for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth \u2018father,\u2019 for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people\u2019s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.  \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are. \u201cWoe to you, blind guides! You say, \u2018If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.\u2019 You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, \u2018If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.\u2019 You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God\u2019s throne and by the one who sits on it. \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices\u2014mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law\u2014justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, \u2018If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\u2019 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started! \u201cYou snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation. \u201cJerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, \u2018Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\u2019\u201d \n\nJesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. \u201cDo you see all these things?\u201d he asked. \u201cTruly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\u201d As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. \u201cTell us,\u201d they said, \u201cwhen will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\u201d Jesus answered: \u201cWatch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, \u2018I am the Messiah,\u2019 and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. \u201cThen you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. \u201cSo when you see standing in the holy place \u2018the abomination that causes desolation,\u2019 spoken of through the prophet Daniel\u2014let the reader understand\u2014 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now\u2014and never to be equaled again. \u201cIf those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Messiah!\u2019 or, \u2018There he is!\u2019 do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time. \u201cSo if anyone tells you, \u2018There he is, out in the wilderness,\u2019 do not go out; or, \u2018Here he is, in the inner rooms,\u2019 do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. \u201cImmediately after the distress of those days\n\u201c\u2018the sun will be darkened,\n    and the moon will not give its light;\nthe stars will fall from the sky,\n    and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.\u2019 \u201cThen will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. \u201cNow learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. \u201cBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. \u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, \u2018My master is staying away a long time,\u2019 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n\n\u201cAt that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. \u201cAt midnight the cry rang out: \u2018Here\u2019s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!\u2019 \u201cThen all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, \u2018Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.\u2019 \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 they replied, \u2018there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.\u2019 \u201cBut while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. \u201cLater the others also came. \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 they said, \u2018open the door for us!\u2019 \u201cBut he replied, \u2018Truly I tell you, I don\u2019t know you.\u2019 \u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour. \u201cAgain, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master\u2019s money. \u201cAfter a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. \u2018Master,\u2019 he said, \u2018you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.\u2019 \u201cHis master replied, \u2018Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master\u2019s happiness!\u2019 \u201cThe man with two bags of gold also came. \u2018Master,\u2019 he said, \u2018you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.\u2019 \u201cHis master replied, \u2018Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master\u2019s happiness!\u2019 \u201cThen the man who had received one bag of gold came. \u2018Master,\u2019 he said, \u2018I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.\u2019 \u201cHis master replied, \u2018You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. \u201c\u2018So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019 \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. \u201cThen the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019 \u201cThen the righteous will answer him, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\u2019 \u201cThe King will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019 \u201cThen he will say to those on his left, \u2018Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019 \u201cThey also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019 \u201cHe will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u2019 \u201cThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\u201d \n\nWhen Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, \u201cAs you know, the Passover is two days away\u2014and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.\u201d Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. \u201cBut not during the festival,\u201d they said, \u201cor there may be a riot among the people.\u201d While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. \u201cWhy this waste?\u201d they asked. \u201cThis perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.\u201d Aware of this, Jesus said to them, \u201cWhy are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\u201d Then one of the Twelve\u2014the one called Judas Iscariot\u2014went to the chief priests and asked, \u201cWhat are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?\u201d So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \u201cWhere do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\u201d He replied, \u201cGo into the city to a certain man and tell him, \u2018The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.\u2019\u201d So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, \u201cTruly I tell you, one of you will betray me.\u201d They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean me, Lord?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cThe one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\u201d Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean me, Rabbi?\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cYou have said so.\u201d While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, \u201cTake and eat; this is my body.\u201d Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, \u201cDrink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus told them, \u201cThis very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:\n\u201c\u2018I will strike the shepherd,\n    and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\u2019 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\u201d Peter replied, \u201cEven if all fall away on account of you, I never will.\u201d \u201cTruly I tell you,\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cthis very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\u201d But Peter declared, \u201cEven if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\u201d And all the other disciples said the same. Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, \u201cSit here while I go over there and pray.\u201d He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, \u201cMy soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\u201d Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \u201cMy Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\u201d Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you men keep watch with me for one hour?\u201d he asked Peter. \u201cWatch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\u201d He went away a second time and prayed, \u201cMy Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.\u201d When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\u201d While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \u201cThe one I kiss is the man; arrest him.\u201d Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \u201cGreetings, Rabbi!\u201d and kissed him. Jesus replied, \u201cDo what you came for, friend.\u201d\nThen the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus\u2019 companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. \u201cPut your sword back in its place,\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cfor all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\u201d In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, \u201cAm I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\u201d Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.\nFinally two came forward and declared, \u201cThis fellow said, \u2018I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.\u2019\u201d Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \u201cAre you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\u201d But Jesus remained silent.\nThe high priest said to him, \u201cI charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.\u201d \u201cYou have said so,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cBut I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\u201d Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \u201cHe has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cHe is worthy of death,\u201d they answered. Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, \u201cProphesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?\u201d Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \u201cYou also were with Jesus of Galilee,\u201d she said. But he denied it before them all. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, \u201cThis fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d He denied it again, with an oath: \u201cI don\u2019t know the man!\u201d After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \u201cSurely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.\u201d Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, \u201cI don\u2019t know the man!\u201d\nImmediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \u201cBefore the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\u201d And he went outside and wept bitterly. \n\nEarly in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed. So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor. When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. \u201cI have sinned,\u201d he said, \u201cfor I have betrayed innocent blood.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that to us?\u201d they replied. \u201cThat\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \u201cIt is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\u201d So they decided to use the money to buy the potter\u2019s field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \u201cThey took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter\u2019s field, as the Lord commanded me.\u201d Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \u201cAre you the king of the Jews?\u201d\n\u201cYou have said so,\u201d Jesus replied. When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, \u201cDon\u2019t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\u201d But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge\u2014to the great amazement of the governor. Now it was the governor\u2019s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas. So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \u201cWhich one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?\u201d For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him. While Pilate was sitting on the judge\u2019s seat, his wife sent him this message: \u201cDon\u2019t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\u201d But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. \u201cWhich of the two do you want me to release to you?\u201d asked the governor.\n\u201cBarabbas,\u201d they answered. \u201cWhat shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?\u201d Pilate asked.\nThey all answered, \u201cCrucify him!\u201d \u201cWhy? What crime has he committed?\u201d asked Pilate.\nBut they shouted all the louder, \u201cCrucify him!\u201d When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \u201cI am innocent of this man\u2019s blood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is your responsibility!\u201d All the people answered, \u201cHis blood is on us and on our children!\u201d Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. Then the governor\u2019s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. \u201cHail, king of the Jews!\u201d they said. They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. They came to a place called Golgotha (which means \u201cthe place of the skull\u201d). There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. Above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the king of the jews. Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \u201cYou who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\u201d In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. \u201cHe saved others,\u201d they said, \u201cbut he can\u2019t save himself! He\u2019s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, \u2018I am the Son of God.\u2019\u201d In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \u201cEli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\u201d (which means \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d). When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \u201cHe\u2019s calling Elijah.\u201d Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, \u201cNow leave him alone. Let\u2019s see if Elijah comes to save him.\u201d And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus\u2019 resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people. When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \u201cSurely he was the Son of God!\u201d Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee\u2019s sons. As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus\u2019 body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. \u201cSir,\u201d they said, \u201cwe remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, \u2018After three days I will rise again.\u2019 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\u201d \u201cTake a guard,\u201d Pilate answered. \u201cGo, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\u201d So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard. \n\nAfter the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, \u201cDo not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: \u2018He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.\u2019 Now I have told you.\u201d So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. \u201cGreetings,\u201d he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\u201d While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, \u201cYou are to say, \u2018His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.\u2019 If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\u201d So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\u201d \n\n",
