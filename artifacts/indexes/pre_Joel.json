Hear this, you elders;\n    listen, all who live in the land.\nHas anything like this ever happened in your days\n    or in the days of your ancestors? Tell it to your children,\n    and let your children tell it to their children,\n    and their children to the next generation. What the locust swarm has left\n    the great locusts have eaten;\nwhat the great locusts have left\n    the young locusts have eaten;\nwhat the young locusts have left\n    other locusts have eaten. Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!\n    Wail, all you drinkers of wine;\nwail because of the new wine,\n    for it has been snatched from your lips. A nation has invaded my land,\n    a mighty army without number;\nit has the teeth of a lion,\n    the fangs of a lioness. It has laid waste my vines\n    and ruined my fig trees.\nIt has stripped off their bark\n    and thrown it away,\n    leaving their branches white. Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth\n    grieving for the betrothed of her youth. Grain offerings and drink offerings\n    are cut off from the house of the Lord.\nThe priests are in mourning,\n    those who minister before the Lord. The fields are ruined,\n    the ground is dried up;\nthe grain is destroyed,\n    the new wine is dried up,\n    the olive oil fails. Despair, you farmers,\n    wail, you vine growers;\ngrieve for the wheat and the barley,\n    because the harvest of the field is destroyed. The vine is dried up\n    and the fig tree is withered;\nthe pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree\u2014\n    all the trees of the field\u2014are dried up.\nSurely the people\u2019s joy\n    is withered away. Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn;\n    wail, you who minister before the altar.\nCome, spend the night in sackcloth,\n    you who minister before my God;\nfor the grain offerings and drink offerings\n    are withheld from the house of your God. Declare a holy fast;\n    call a sacred assembly.\nSummon the elders\n    and all who live in the land\nto the house of the Lord your God,\n    and cry out to the Lord. Alas for that day!\n    For the day of the Lord is near;\n    it will come like destruction from the Almighty. Has not the food been cut off\n    before our very eyes\u2014\njoy and gladness\n    from the house of our God? The seeds are shriveled\n    beneath the clods.\nThe storehouses are in ruins,\n    the granaries have been broken down,\n    for the grain has dried up. How the cattle moan!\n    The herds mill about\nbecause they have no pasture;\n    even the flocks of sheep are suffering. To you, Lord, I call,\n    for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness\n    and flames have burned up all the trees of the field. Even the wild animals pant for you;\n    the streams of water have dried up\n    and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness. \n\nBlow the trumpet in Zion;\n    sound the alarm on my holy hill.\nLet all who live in the land tremble,\n    for the day of the Lord is coming.\nIt is close at hand\u2014 a day of darkness and gloom,\n    a day of clouds and blackness.\nLike dawn spreading across the mountains\n    a large and mighty army comes,\nsuch as never was in ancient times\n    nor ever will be in ages to come. Before them fire devours,\n    behind them a flame blazes.\nBefore them the land is like the garden of Eden,\n    behind them, a desert waste\u2014\n    nothing escapes them. They have the appearance of horses;\n    they gallop along like cavalry. With a noise like that of chariots\n    they leap over the mountaintops,\nlike a crackling fire consuming stubble,\n    like a mighty army drawn up for battle. At the sight of them, nations are in anguish;\n    every face turns pale. They charge like warriors;\n    they scale walls like soldiers.\nThey all march in line,\n    not swerving from their course. They do not jostle each other;\n    each marches straight ahead.\nThey plunge through defenses\n    without breaking ranks. They rush upon the city;\n    they run along the wall.\nThey climb into the houses;\n    like thieves they enter through the windows. Before them the earth shakes,\n    the heavens tremble,\nthe sun and moon are darkened,\n    and the stars no longer shine. The Lord thunders\n    at the head of his army;\nhis forces are beyond number,\n    and mighty is the army that obeys his command.\nThe day of the Lord is great;\n    it is dreadful.\n    Who can endure it? \u201cEven now,\u201d declares the Lord,\n    \u201creturn to me with all your heart,\n    with fasting and weeping and mourning.\u201d Rend your heart\n    and not your garments.\nReturn to the Lord your God,\n    for he is gracious and compassionate,\nslow to anger and abounding in love,\n    and he relents from sending calamity. Who knows? He may turn and relent\n    and leave behind a blessing\u2014\ngrain offerings and drink offerings\n    for the Lord your God. Blow the trumpet in Zion,\n    declare a holy fast,\n    call a sacred assembly. Gather the people,\n    consecrate the assembly;\nbring together the elders,\n    gather the children,\n    those nursing at the breast.\nLet the bridegroom leave his room\n    and the bride her chamber. Let the priests, who minister before the Lord,\n    weep between the portico and the altar.\nLet them say, \u201cSpare your people, Lord.\n    Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn,\n    a byword among the nations.\nWhy should they say among the peoples,\n    \u2018Where is their God?\u2019\u201d Then the Lord was jealous for his land\n    and took pity on his people. The Lord replied to them:\n\u201cI am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil,\n    enough to satisfy you fully;\nnever again will I make you\n    an object of scorn to the nations. \u201cI will drive the northern horde far from you,\n    pushing it into a parched and barren land;\nits eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea\n    and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea.\nAnd its stench will go up;\n    its smell will rise.\u201d\nSurely he has done great things! Do not be afraid, land of Judah;\n    be glad and rejoice.\nSurely the Lord has done great things! Do not be afraid, you wild animals,\n    for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green.\nThe trees are bearing their fruit;\n    the fig tree and the vine yield their riches. Be glad, people of Zion,\n    rejoice in the Lord your God,\nfor he has given you the autumn rains\n    because he is faithful.\nHe sends you abundant showers,\n    both autumn and spring rains, as before. The threshing floors will be filled with grain;\n    the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. \u201cI will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten\u2014\n    the great locust and the young locust,\n    the other locusts and the locust swarm\u2014\nmy great army that I sent among you. You will have plenty to eat, until you are full,\n    and you will praise the name of the Lord your God,\n    who has worked wonders for you;\nnever again will my people be shamed. Then you will know that I am in Israel,\n    that I am the Lord your God,\n    and that there is no other;\nnever again will my people be shamed. \u201cAnd afterward,\n    I will pour out my Spirit on all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy,\n    your old men will dream dreams,\n    your young men will see visions. Even on my servants, both men and women,\n    I will pour out my Spirit in those days. I will show wonders in the heavens\n    and on the earth,\n    blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness\n    and the moon to blood\n    before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And everyone who calls\n    on the name of the Lord will be saved;\nfor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\n    there will be deliverance,\n    as the Lord has said,\neven among the survivors\n    whom the Lord calls. \n\n\u201cIn those days and at that time,\n    when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, I will gather all nations\n    and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.\nThere I will put them on trial\n    for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel,\nbecause they scattered my people among the nations\n    and divided up my land. They cast lots for my people\n    and traded boys for prostitutes;\n    they sold girls for wine to drink. \u201cNow what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples. You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland. \u201cSee, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done. I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.\u201d The Lord has spoken. Proclaim this among the nations:\n    Prepare for war!\nRouse the warriors!\n    Let all the fighting men draw near and attack. Beat your plowshares into swords\n    and your pruning hooks into spears.\nLet the weakling say,\n    \u201cI am strong!\u201d Come quickly, all you nations from every side,\n    and assemble there.\nBring down your warriors, Lord! \u201cLet the nations be roused;\n    let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,\nfor there I will sit\n    to judge all the nations on every side. Swing the sickle,\n    for the harvest is ripe.\nCome, trample the grapes,\n    for the winepress is full\n    and the vats overflow\u2014\nso great is their wickedness!\u201d Multitudes, multitudes\n    in the valley of decision!\nFor the day of the Lord is near\n    in the valley of decision. The sun and moon will be darkened,\n    and the stars no longer shine. The Lord will roar from Zion\n    and thunder from Jerusalem;\n    the earth and the heavens will tremble.\nBut the Lord will be a refuge for his people,\n    a stronghold for the people of Israel. \u201cThen you will know that I, the Lord your God,\n    dwell in Zion, my holy hill.\nJerusalem will be holy;\n    never again will foreigners invade her. \u201cIn that day the mountains will drip new wine,\n    and the hills will flow with milk;\n    all the ravines of Judah will run with water.\nA fountain will flow out of the Lord\u2019s house\n    and will water the valley of acacias. But Egypt will be desolate,\n    Edom a desert waste,\nbecause of violence done to the people of Judah,\n    in whose land they shed innocent blood. Judah will be inhabited forever\n    and Jerusalem through all generations. Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged?\n    No, I will not.\u201d\nThe Lord dwells in Zion! \n\n",
